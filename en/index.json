[{"categories":null,"contents":"In this guide, you will learn how to configure a slave DNS server using BIND9 on Debian. This server will sync with the master server (dns1.javiercruces.org) and distribute the name resolution load in your local network. You will also be guided to verify that the zone transfer works correctly.\nIn this case, the slave server is located in the 192.168.10.0/24 network, with the IP 192.168.10.200.\n1. Initial Setup of the Slave Server Hostname First, assign the correct hostname. Edit the /etc/hostname file:\ndns2 Next, configure the /etc/hosts file to associate the fully qualified domain name with the local IP:\n127.0.1.1 dns2.javiercruces.org dns2 Verify that the FQDN resolves correctly using hostname -f. You should get the following output:\ndebian@dns2:~$ hostname -f dns2.javiercruces.org 2. Installing BIND9 Install the BIND9 package as we did on the master server:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install bind9 bind9utils bind9-doc rsync -y 3. Basic Configuration Edit named.conf.options On the slave server, edit the /etc/bind/named.conf.options file to allow queries from internal networks:\noptions { directory \u0026#34;/var/cache/bind\u0026#34;; allow-query { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.10.0/24; }; recursion yes; dnssec-validation no; forwarders { 1.1.1.1; 8.8.8.8; }; }; 4. Configuring Slave Zones Edit the /etc/bind/named.conf.local file to define the slave zones. These should match the zones configured on the master server:\nzone \u0026#34;javiercruces.org\u0026#34; { type slave; masters { 192.168.10.1; }; file \u0026#34;/var/cache/bind/slaves/db.javiercruces.org\u0026#34;; }; zone \u0026#34;10.168.192.in-addr.arpa\u0026#34; { type slave; masters { 192.168.10.1; }; file \u0026#34;/var/cache/bind/slaves/db.192.168.10\u0026#34;; }; Create the directory to store the slave files if it does not exist:\nsudo mkdir -p /var/cache/bind/slaves sudo chown bind:bind /var/cache/bind/slaves 5. Restarting the Service Once everything is configured, restart the BIND9 service:\nsudo systemctl restart bind9 Check for errors in the event log:\nsudo journalctl -xeu bind9 You can also check if the zones were transferred correctly by running:\nls -l /var/cache/bind/slaves 6. Updating the Master Server For the slave server to receive the zones correctly, it needs to be authorized by the master server (dns1).\nEdit the /etc/bind/named.conf.local file on the master server and add the allow-transfer option with the slave\u0026rsquo;s IP:\nzone \u0026#34;javiercruces.org\u0026#34; { type master; file \u0026#34;/var/cache/bind/db.javiercruces.org\u0026#34;; allow-transfer { 192.168.10.200; }; }; zone \u0026#34;10.168.192.in-addr.arpa\u0026#34; { type master; file \u0026#34;/var/cache/bind/db.192.168.10\u0026#34;; allow-transfer { 192.168.10.200; }; }; Additionally, we will update the DNS records to add the new server. You need to add an A record and an NS record. Here\u0026rsquo;s the complete file:\ndebian@dns1:~$ sudo cat /var/cache/bind/db.javiercruces.org $TTL 86400 @ IN SOA dns1.javiercruces.org. root.javiercruces.org. ( 1 ; Serial 604800 ; Refresh 86400 ; Retry 2419200 ; Expire 86400 ) ; Negative Cache TTL ; @ IN NS dns1.javiercruces.org. @ IN NS dns2.javiercruces.org. @ IN MX 10 correo.javiercruces.org. $ORIGIN javiercruces.org. dns1 IN A 192.168.10.1 dns2 IN A 192.168.10.200 correo IN A 192.168.10.2 thor IN A 192.168.10.3 hela IN A 192.168.10.4 www IN CNAME thor informatica IN CNAME thor ftp IN CNAME hela We must also update the reverse zone:\n$TTL 86400 @ IN SOA dns1.javiercruces.org. root.javiercruces.org.

After saving the changes, reload the BIND configuration:\nsudo rndc reload Or restart the service:\nsudo systemctl restart bind9 With this, the master server is authorized to send zones to the slave when necessary.\n7. Verifications Every time you restart the service on dns1, it will send changes to dns2. To verify that the zone transfer is working correctly, run the following command on dns2 to view logs in real-time:\ndebian@dns2:~$ sudo journalctl -u named -f Then, add a record on the master server:\nsentinel IN A 192.168.10.25 You can force the zone transfer with:\ndebian@dns2:~$ sudo rndc sync And the logs of a successful transfer will look like this:\ndebian@dns2:~$ sudo journalctl -u named -f May 10 23:11:08 dns2 named[936]: received control channel command \u0026#39;sync\u0026#39; May 10 23:11:08 dns2 named[936]: dumping all zones: success Finally, perform a query to both servers to verify that both return the same result:\ndebian@cliente1:~$ dig @192.168.10.1 sentinel.javiercruces.org ; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; DiG 9.18.33-1~deb12u2-Debian \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; @192.168.10.1 sentinel.javiercruces.org ; (1 server found) ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -\u0026gt;\u0026gt;HEADER\u0026lt;\u0026lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 31484 ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1 ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION: ; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 1232 ; COOKIE: 067375f875fc084c01000000681fdf328945678dcc84fea2 (good) ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;sentinel.javiercruces.org.\tIN\tA ;; ANSWER SECTION: sentinel.javiercruces.org. 86400 IN\tA\t192.168.10.25 ;; Query time: 0 msec ;; SERVER: 192.168.10.1#53(192.168.10.1) (UDP) ;; WHEN: Sat May 10 23:20:18 UTC 2025 ;; MSG SIZE rcvd: 98 debian@cliente1:~$ dig @192.168.10.200 sentinel.javiercruces.org ; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; DiG 9.18.33-1~deb12u2-Debian \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; @192.168.10.200 sentinel.javiercruces.org ; (1 server found) ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -\u0026gt;\u0026gt;HEADER\u0026lt;\u0026lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 29032 ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1 ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION: ; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 1232 ; COOKIE: 4fd30029eb8c1f3d01000000681fdf34b473e093120ca15c (good) ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;sentinel.javiercruces.org.\tIN\tA ;; AUTHORITY SECTION: javiercruces.org.\t86400\tIN\tSOA\tdns1.javiercruces.org. root.javiercruces.org. 1 604800 8 6400 2419200 86400 ;; Query time: 0 msec ;; SERVER: 192.168.10.200#53(192.168.10.200) (UDP) ;; WHEN: Sat May 10 23:20:20 UTC 2025 ;; MSG SIZE rcvd: 128 ","date":"May 10, 2025","hero":"/images/servicios/dns/dns_esclavo.png","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/servicios/dns/bind9/dns_esclavo/dns_esclavo/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this guide, you will learn how to configure a slave DNS server using BIND9 on Debian.

Docker Compose on Ubuntu 24"},{"categories":null,"contents":"To start using Docker Engine on Ubuntu, make sure you meet the prerequisites and follow the installation steps.\nPrerequisites Operating System Requirements To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Ubuntu releases:\nUbuntu Oracular 24.10 Ubuntu Noble 24.04 (LTS) Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 (LTS) Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS) Docker Engine for Ubuntu is compatible with x86_64 (or amd64), armhf, arm64, s390x, and ppc64le (ppc64el) architectures.\nNote: Installation on Ubuntu-derived distributions, such as Linux Mint, is not officially supported (although it may work).\nUninstall Older Versions Before installing Docker Engine, you should uninstall any conflicting packages.\nYour Linux distribution may provide unofficial Docker packages that could conflict with the official packages provided by Docker. You need to uninstall these packages before installing the official version of Docker Engine.\nThe unofficial packages to uninstall are:\ndocker.io docker-compose docker-compose-v2 docker-doc podman-docker Additionally, Docker Engine depends on containerd and runc. Docker Engine packages these dependencies into a single package: containerd.io. If you have previously installed containerd or runc, uninstall them to avoid conflicts with the versions included in Docker Engine.\nRun the following command to uninstall all conflicting packages:\nfor pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done apt-get may report that you have none of these packages installed.\nImages, containers, volumes, and networks stored in /var/lib/docker/ are not automatically removed when you uninstall Docker. If you want to start with a clean installation and remove existing data, refer to the uninstall section for Docker Engine.\nInstallation Methods You can install Docker Engine in various ways, depending on your needs:\nDocker Engine is included with Docker Desktop for Linux. This is the easiest and fastest way to get started. Set up and install Docker Engine from the Docker apt repository. Install it manually and manage updates manually. Use a convenience script. Only recommended for testing and development environments. Install Using the Apt Repository Before installing Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker apt repository. After this, you will be able to install and update Docker from the repository.\nSet up the Docker apt repository:\nAdd the official Docker GPG key:\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc Add the repository to the Apt sources:\necho \u0026#34;deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo \u0026#34;${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}\u0026#34;) stable\u0026#34; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list \u0026gt; /dev/null sudo apt-get update Install Docker packages:\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin Verify that the installation was successful by running the hello-world image:\nsudo docker run hello-world This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.\nYou have now correctly installed and started Docker Engine.\nTip:\nIf you encounter errors trying to run without root, make sure to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands. See the following steps for installation on Linux to allow this.\nUpdate Docker Engine To update Docker Engine, follow step 2 of the installation instructions, choosing the new version you want to install.\nInstall from a Package If you are unable to use the Docker apt repository to install Docker Engine, you can download the .deb file for your version and install it manually. You will need to download a new file each time you wish to update Docker Engine.\nGo to https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/.\nSelect your version of Ubuntu from the list, then go to pool/stable/ and select the applicable architecture (amd64, armhf, arm64, or s390x).\nDownload the following .deb files:\ncontainerd.io_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.deb docker-ce_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.deb docker-ce-cli_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.deb docker-buildx-plugin_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.deb docker-compose-plugin_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.deb Install the .deb packages:\nsudo dpkg -i ./containerd.io_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.deb ./docker-ce_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.deb ./docker-ce-cli_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.deb ./docker-buildx-plugin_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.deb ./docker-compose-plugin_\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt;.deb The Docker daemon will automatically start.\nVerify that the installation was successful by running the hello-world image:\nsudo service docker start sudo docker run hello-world You have now correctly installed and started Docker Engine.\nInstall Using the Convenience Script Docker provides a convenience script at https://get.docker.com/ to install Docker in non-interactive fashion in development environments. This script is not recommended for production environments, but it is useful for creating a provisioning script tailored to your needs.\ncurl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh sudo sh ./get-docker.sh Uninstall Docker Engine To uninstall Docker Engine, run the following command:\nsudo apt-get purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin docker-ce-rootless-extras Images, containers, volumes, or custom configuration files are not automatically deleted. To remove all Docker elements, run:\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker sudo rm -rf /var/lib/containerd Remove the sources list and keys:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list sudo rm /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc You will need to remove any manually edited configuration files.\nNext Steps Managing Docker as a Non-root User The Docker daemon binds to a Unix socket, not to a TCP port. By default, the root user owns the Unix socket, and other users can only access it using sudo. The Docker daemon always runs as the root user.\nIf you do not want to prepend the docker command with sudo, you can create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible to members of the docker group. On some Linux distributions, the system automatically creates this group when installing Docker Engine using a package manager. In this case, you do not need to create the group manually.\nWarning\nThe docker group grants root-level privileges to the user. For more details on how this affects security on your system, see Docker Daemon Attack Surface.\nNote\nTo run Docker without root privileges, see Running the Docker daemon as a non-root user (Rootless mode).\nCreate the docker group and add your user 1. Create the docker group: sudo groupadd docker 2. Add your user to the docker group: sudo usermod -aG docker $USER 3. Log out and log back in for your group membership to be reevaluated. If you are running Linux on a virtual machine, you may need to restart the virtual machine for the changes to take effect.\nYou can also run the following command to activate the changes in groups:\nnewgrp docker 4. Verify that you can run Docker commands without sudo: docker run hello-world This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.\nIf you initially ran Docker CLI commands using sudo before adding your user to the docker group, you might see the following error:\nWARNING: Error loading config file: /home/user/.docker/config.json - stat /home/user/.docker/config.json: permission denied This error indicates that the permission settings for the ~/.docker/ directory are incorrect, due to having used the sudo command earlier.\nSolution To fix this issue, delete the ~/.docker/ directory (it will be recreated automatically, but any custom settings will be lost), or change the ownership and permissions using the following commands:\nsudo chown \u0026#34;$USER\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;$USER\u0026#34; /home/\u0026#34;$USER\u0026#34;/.docker -R sudo chmod g+rwx \u0026#34;$HOME/.docker\u0026#34; -R Configure Docker to Start Automatically with systemd Many modern Linux distributions use systemd to manage which services start when the system boots. On Debian and Ubuntu, the Docker service automatically starts on boot. To automatically start Docker and containerd on boot on other Linux distributions that use systemd, run the following commands:\nsudo systemctl enable docker.service sudo systemctl enable containerd.service To stop this behavior, use disable instead of enable:\nsudo systemctl disable docker.service sudo systemctl disable containerd.service You can use systemd unit files to configure the Docker service at startup, for example, to add an HTTP proxy, set a different directory or partition for Docker\u0026rsquo;s runtime files, or make other customizations. For an example, see Configure the daemon to use a proxy.\nConfigure the Default Logging Driver Docker provides logging drivers to collect and view log data from all containers running on a host. The default logging driver, json-file, writes log data to JSON-formatted files in the host\u0026rsquo;s filesystem. Over time, these log files can increase in size, potentially leading to disk resource exhaustion.\nTo avoid issues with excessive disk usage due to log data, consider one of the following options:\nConfigure the json-file logging driver to enable log rotation. Use an alternative logging driver such as the \u0026ldquo;local\u0026rdquo; logging driver, which performs log rotation by default. Use a logging driver that sends logs to a remote logging aggregator.

If this sounds familiar, don\u0026rsquo;t worry—I’ve got you covered.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been investigating and found a tool that can save you several headaches. It\u0026rsquo;s called EnvyControl, a command-line utility (CLI) that allows you to easily choose which graphics card you want to use on your computer. This is especially useful if your laptop has a hybrid graphics configuration, such as Intel + NVIDIA or AMD + NVIDIA.\nIn my case, I set up the tool to always use the dedicated GPU, and voilà! The video ports started working smoothly.\nEnvyControl is free, open-source, and distributed under the MIT license. Please note that the software is provided as is, without guarantees. Additionally, any custom X.org settings could be overwritten when switching modes.\nIf you want to try it, here is the repository link: EnvyControl on GitHub. There, you will find specific installation tutorials for different distributions.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s go through the steps to install it on Debian.\nEnvyControl Installation Since it is no longer possible to install pip packages outside a virtual environment after the adoption of PEP 668, you should use the .deb package provided in the repository instead.\nFind the latest version at the following link: Releases - EnvyControl.\nOn that page, select and download the corresponding .deb package. You can also use the wget tool to download it from the terminal.\nInstall the downloaded package with the following command:\nsudo apt -y install ./python3-envycontrol_version.deb Using EnvyControl Once you have installed the tool, you can select the GPU you want to use on your computer. Keep in mind that any applied settings will not take effect until you reboot the system.\nTo use the integrated GPU (for power saving):\nsudo envycontrol -s integrated To enable hybrid mode (both GPUs):\nsudo envycontrol -s hybrid --rtd3 To use only the dedicated GPU (recommended if you need external video ports):\nFirst, switch to hybrid mode:\nsudo envycontrol -s hybrid Then, switch to dedicated GPU mode:\nsudo envycontrol -s nvidia --force-comp --coolbits 24 ⚠️ REMEMBER TO REBOOT FOR CHANGES TO APPLY.\nAdditional Notes I\u0026rsquo;ve provided the commands that worked for me, but EnvyControl has its own manual. You can also find more information in the official repository.\nAdditionally, there is a GNOME extension that allows you to switch GPUs through a graphical interface. While I personally always work with my laptop plugged in, you might want to switch to hybrid or integrated mode when on battery.\nConclusion By now, your NVIDIA drivers should be working properly, and you should be able to use your laptop\u0026rsquo;s video ports without issues.\nAs mentioned earlier, compatibility may vary depending on your hardware. In my case, video ports only work when I use the dedicated GPU mode.

In addition, at the end of the article, you will learn to install a key tool called Nvidia Optimus, which will provide you with the ability to select which graphics card you will use.\nThis tool is especially useful in laptops, as it is common for these devices to present problems when emitting video through ports, a situation that can be easily with this tool.\nIdentification of Our GPU Before we embark on installation and configuration, it is essential to know the hardware of our computer. To find out which graphics cards are available in our system, we will use the following command:\njaviercruces@HPOMEN15:~$ lspci -nn | egrep -i \u0026#34;3d|display|vga\u0026#34; 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GA106M [GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile / Max-Q] [10de:2520] (rev a1) 06:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Cezanne [Radeon Vega Series / Radeon Vega Mobile Series] [1002:1638] (rev c5) As you can see in the output of the previous command, my laptop has two graphics cards. Identifying the model is crucial, as if we choose a manual driver installation, we will need the specific for our GPU.\nHowever, in Debian we have a utility that simplifies this process, indicating which controller we should install. However, to access this utility, we need to modify our Debian repositories.\nTo make this modification, we will add the \u0026ldquo;non-free\u0026rdquo; section to our repositories using a text editor of our preference:\njaviercruces@HPOMEN15:~$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware Remember that every time you modify this file you have to make an update for it to be updated.\njaviercruces@HPOMEN15:~$ sudo apt update -y With our properly updated repositories, we will proceed to install the NVIDIA detection script with the following command:\njaviercruces@HPOMEN15:~$ sudo apt install nvidia-detect We will now run the NVIDIA script; as you can see, it will provide us with detailed information about our NVIDIA graphics card, as well as the various compatible drivers and the recommended Debian package for installation:\njaviercruces@HPOMEN15:~$ nvidia-detect Detected NVIDIA GPUs: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GA106M [GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile / Max-Q] [10de:2520] (rev a1) Checking card: NVIDIA Corporation GA106M [GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile / Max-Q] (rev a1) Your card is supported by all driver versions. Your card is also supported by the Tesla drivers series. Your card is also supported by the Tesla 470 drivers series. It is recommended to install the nvidia-driver package. Recommended driver installation Before installing the drivers, you must get the right kernel headers so that the NVIDIA controller can compile correctly.\nIn a typical 64-bit system that uses the default kernel, you just run:\njaviercruces@HPOMEN15:~$ sudo apt install linux-headers-amd64 For 32-bit systems with the no-PAE kernel, instead, you would make the following installation:\njaviercruces@HPOMEN15:~$ sudo apt install linux-headers-686 Once the driver\u0026rsquo;s dependencies are installed, we will install the same:\njaviercruces@HPOMEN15:~$ sudo apt install nvidia-driver -y During installation, you are likely to find a typically blue screen that informs you about a conflict with the \u0026ldquo;nouveau\u0026rdquo; driver, which is the driver installed automatically by Debian due to its free software features. Simply click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; on this screen and continue the installation process.\nAt the end of the installation, you will need to restart your equipment to load the NVIDIA module. After reboot, you can check if it has been properly loaded using the following command. Using the tilted bar (/), you can filter the output by writing the word \u0026ldquo;nvidia,\u0026rdquo; which will take you directly to the relevant information on your graphic card, allowing you to confirm that the NVIDIA module is loaded.\nYou have to check that on the line \u0026ldquo;Kernel driver in use,\u0026rdquo; have the nvidia module.\njaviercruces@HPOMEN15:~$ lspci -knn | less 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GA106M [GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile / Max-Q] [10de:2520] (rev a1) DeviceName: NVIDIA Graphics Device Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company GA106M [GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile / Max-Q] [103c:88d1] Kernel driver in use: nvidia Kernel modules: nouveau, nvidia_current_drm, nvidia_current You may not have noticed but now on your desktop you will have an app called nvidia-settings with which you can set your graph.\nIn addition if you want to see from the command line information of your GPU NVIDIA you have at your disposal the following command:\njaviercruces@HPOMEN15:~$ nvidia-smi Fri Dec 29 02:04:58 2023 +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 525.125.06 Driver Version: 525.125.06 CUDA Version: 12.0 | |-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | GPU Name Persistence-M| Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

Throughout the article, different connection scenarios are explored, starting with configurations between databases of the same type, such as Oracle to Oracle or PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL, and then moving towards heterogeneous connections between different technologies, such as Oracle to MySQL, PostgreSQL to Oracle, and vice versa. It also covers the steps needed to configure links, create users, and modify key configuration files, allowing remote consultations.\nHomogeneous Connections Oracle to Oracle We will interconnect two Oracle databases, which we will call oracle1 and oracle2 to differentiate them throughout this practice.\nUser Creation in Oracle1 First, we will create a user in Oracle1 who has permissions to connect to the database and to create database links:\nTo verify that the user has been created correctly, disconnect from the current user and reconnect with the new user:\nUser Creation in Oracle2 Repeat the steps made in Oracle1 to create a user in Oracle2 with appropriate permissions to remotely connect and create database links:\nVerify the connection to the new user created:\nConfiguration of listener.ora and tnsnames.ora Files in ORACLE1 To ensure interconnection, we must configure the files listener.ora and tnsnames.ora. This will allow ORACLE1 to listen to the connections and recognize the location of ORACLE2.\nListener.ora Configuration Edit the listener.ora file so that ORACLE1 can listen to connections on the network:\nNote: Although it is recommended to allow connections only from specific IPs, in this test environment we have enabled general access. This file also defines the port used by Oracle.\nTnsnames.ora Configuration We will now set the file tnsnames.ora so that ORACLE1 knows where ORACLE2 is:\nIn this example, ORACLE2 is configured under IP 192.168.122.13 and listens on port 1521. It is also important to know the name of the remote service. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know it, you can run the following command on ORACLE2:\nConnectivity Verification To confirm that ORACLE1 can communicate with ORACLE2, we will use the tnsping tool with the configured alias:\nRemember! If you did not set the listener.ora on the remote server (ORACLE2), this test will fail.\nConfiguration of listener.ora and tnsnames.ora Files in ORACLE2 We will now repeat the same steps in ORACLE2 so that it can communicate with ORACLE1.\nListener.ora Configuration Edit the listener.ora file so that ORACLE2 listens to incoming connections:\nIn this case, we have configured ORACLE2 to listen on any IP, using port 1521, as in ORACLE1.\nTnsnames.ora Configuration Edit the tnsnames.ora file to define an alias that allows ORACLE2 to communicate with ORACLE1:\nConnectivity Verification Use the tnsping tool in ORACLE2 with the alias set for ORACLE1:\nIf the output is successful, it means that ORACLE2 can communicate with ORACLE1.\nRemember! If you did not set the listener.ora on the remote server (ORACLE1), this test will fail.\nCreation of the Link from ORACLE1 to ORACLE2 At this stage, we will establish a link from ORACLE1 to ORACLE2. We will use a user with link creation privileges, such as javiercruces1, which was created earlier.\nThe link will receive a name, in this case, ORACLE2_LINK. We will specify that we will use the remote user credentials javiercruces2 and the connection defined in the file tnsnames.ora for ORACLE2.\nLink Verification To verify, we will create the dept table in ORACLE2 and consult from ORACLE1:\nCreation of the Link from ORACLE2 to ORACLE1 We will now set the link in the opposite direction, from ORACLE2 to ORACLE1. We will follow the same procedure.\nWith the user javiercruces2, we will create a link called ORACLE1_LINK. This link will use the remote user credentials javiercruces1 and the connection defined in the tnsnames.ora file for ORACLE1:\nLink Verification We will conduct a simple consultation using the newly created link:\nSimultaneous Consultations between ORACLE1 and ORACLE2 Now, we will check that it is possible to consult using both databases simultaneously from ORACLE1:\nThis same consultation can also be made from ORACLE2:\nPostgreSQL to PostgreSQL To allow interconnection, it is essential to configure both machines to listen to requests. This is achieved by defining the IPs and ports in the configuration file located in /etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf:\nIn addition, it is necessary to set up the networks from which connections will be accepted. This is done in the file pg_hba.conf:\nAfter making these changes, we will restart the PostgreSQL service to apply them:\nAs in the previous section, we will use the Scott table schema, placing a table in each database for \u0026ldquo;remote\u0026rdquo; consultations.\nInterconnect PostgreSQL1 to PostgreSQL2 To interconnect the databases, we will use dblink, a module that allows for consultations and operations distributed between PostgreSQL databases. This is achieved by establishing direct connections between them.\nUser Creation and Database in PostgreSQL1 First, we create the users and database in PostgreSQL1:\nEnable dblink Extension We will activate the dblink extension in PostgreSQL1:\nCreation of the Connection to PostgreSQL2 We will use the dblink module to establish a connection to PostgreSQL2:\nConduct Consultations Using dblink Once the connection is created, we can conduct remote consultations from PostgreSQL1:\nNote: It is a bit tedious to define the fields for each remote consultation, which may make it difficult to use in more complex consultations.\nInterconnect PostgreSQL2 to PostgreSQL1 User Creation and Database in PostgreSQL2 We will create the users and database in PostgreSQL2 following a process similar to that in PostgreSQL1:\nEnable dblink Extension and Create Connection to PostgreSQL1 We will activate the dblink extension and configure the connection to PostgreSQL1:\nConduct Consultations Towards PostgreSQL1 Now, we can consult from PostgreSQL2 to PostgreSQL1:\nSimultaneous Consultations between PostgreSQL1 and PostgreSQL2 To simplify remote consultations between the two databases, we can create views. This avoids the need to manually define the type of each field in the consultations:\nThe same consultation can be made from PostgreSQL1 to PostgreSQL2:\nHeterogeneous Connections Oracle to MySQL ODBC Driver Installation for MySQL First, we download the ODBC driver for MySQL along with the necessary dependencies:\nWe access the official MySQL page to download the drivers and proceed to their installation:\nConfiguration of Heterogeneous Services in Oracle We access the hs/admin directory within our Oracle installation:\nWe edit the initMYSQL.ora file with the following content to configure Heterogeneous Services:\nODBC Configuration for MySQL We set ODBC for MySQL, making sure we include the right credentials to connect to the MySQL database:\nConfiguration of the Listener in Oracle We update the listener configuration to include localhost and the Oracle listening port:\nWe restart the Oracle listener service to apply the changes:\nODBC Driver Check We check that the ODBC driver is working properly by connecting to the MySQL database. We can also use the isql driver to check the connection:\nCreation of the Link between Oracle and MySQL We created the link in Oracle to connect to the MySQL database:\nConducting Consultations between Oracle and MySQL We can make a simple consultation to the MySQL database:\nIt is also possible to consult using both databases simultaneously. It is important to lock in double quotes the names of MySQL fields and tables to be interpreted correctly:\nMySQL to Oracle Oracle to PostgreSQL Note: A machine with Oracle Linux 8 and Oracle Database 23 was used for this section.\nPrevious Configuration in Oracle As an initial step, we created again a user and database in Oracle, assigning the appropriate permissions:\nDriver Installation for PostgreSQL We install the PostgreSQL driver using dnf. This command will also install the necessary libraries as dependencies:\nFile Configuration odbcinst.ini The /etc/odbcinst.ini file is used in Linux systems to configure ODBC drivers. We edit this file to register the PostgreSQL driver:\nFile Configuration odbc.ini The /etc/odbc.ini file contains specific settings for each connection to a database. Here are the details of the connection to the PostgreSQL database:\nConfiguration in Oracle to Use the Driver We configure Oracle so it can use the ODBC driver. This includes updating the files needed to set up the connection:\nConfiguration of the Listener in Oracle We configure the listener file to enable communication with the PostgreSQL database:\nFile Configuration tnsnames.ora We add an entry to the tnsnames.ora file to define the connection to PostgreSQL:\nReboot of the Listener We restart the listener service to apply the changes:\nConnection Test We check the connectivity using tnsping:\nIn addition, we test the connection using the ODBC driver from the terminal:\nCreation of the Link in Oracle We connect to Oracle and create the link to the PostgreSQL database. In the queries, the names of fields and tables should go between double quotes, and the values between single quotes:\nSimultaneous Consultations between Oracle and PostgreSQL We can conduct combined consultations between the two databases:\nPostgreSQL to Oracle Download and Install Necessary Packages From the official Oracle page, we will download the following required packages:\nSince the system used is Debian, it is necessary to convert the RPM-format packages to DEB using alien. The process will take about 5 minutes, and the packages will be installed automatically when using the -i parameter:\nOracle Connection Test Once the packages are installed, we check that it is possible to remotely connect to the Oracle database to ensure that the configuration is correct:\nDownload and Compile oracle_fdw The next step is to install oracle_fdw, an extension for PostgreSQL that allows you to connect to Oracle. We download the latest version from the official repository:\nRepository: oracle_fdw in GitHub We clone the repository and compile the source code:\nWithin the downloaded directory, we run make to compile:\nFinally, we install the extension with the make install command:\nPostgreSQL Configuration Creation of Extension: We connect to the PostgreSQL database where we want to create the link and set the extension oracle_fdw:\nCreation of the Schema and Foreign Server: We create a schema called oracle and set up a foreign server pointing to the Oracle database:\nUser Mapping: We create a mapping between the local PostgreSQL user (javiercruces1) and the remote Oracle user (javiercruces3). We also grant the necessary permissions on the schema and the foreign server:\nImportation of the Schema: With the local PostgreSQL user, we import the Oracle user\u0026rsquo;s table schema to the local foreign server:\nCombined Consultations Finally, we can conduct consultations involving data from both databases (PostgreSQL and Oracle). This allows us to work with information distributed in an integrated manner:\n","date":"September 1, 2024","hero":"/images/base_de_datos/interconexion_de_servidores/interconexion_de_servidores.png","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/base_de_datos/interconexion_de_servidores/interconexion_servidores/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post addresses how to configure and manage connections between different databases, both homogeneous and heterogeneous, to facilitate interoperability between various database systems.

PostgreSQL installation\nTo install PostgreSQL in Debian 12, follow these steps:\nUpdate the repositories and install PostgreSQL * *: First, make sure your system is updated and install PostgreSQL:\n```bash sudo apt update sudo apt install postgresql ``` Verifies that the service is in operation * *: After installation, make sure that the PostgreSQL service is in operation:\n```bash sudo systemctl status postgresql ``` You should see a message that indicates the service is active (running).\n#2. Creation of a User and Allocation of Permissions\nAccess the user \u0026lsquo;postgres\u0026rsquo; * *: PostgreSQL creates a user called \u0026lsquo;postgres\u0026rsquo; during installation. Access this user to perform the configuration tasks:\n```bash sudo -u postgres psql ``` If you want you can change the user\u0026rsquo;s password to the database with the following command:\n```sql ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'tu_nueva_contraseña'; ``` Create a new user * *: Within the \u0026lsquo;postgres\u0026rsquo; prompt, to create a new user uses the following command.\n```sql CREATE USER javiercruces WITH PASSWORD 'tu_contraseña'; ``` Create a new database * *: Then create a database that will be associated with your new user.\n```sql CREATE DATABASE mypgdatabase OWNER mypguser; ``` Create an administrator user * * If you want to create a user with all the privileges in a database, enter the following command:\n```sql GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nombre_base_de_datos TO nombre_usuario; ``` Get out of the console with \u0026lsquo;\\ q\u0026rsquo;:\n```sql \\q ``` #3. Connection test\nConnect to PostgreSQL with the new user * *: From the user \u0026lsquo;postgres\u0026rsquo;, or directly from your terminal, try to connect to PostgreSQL using the new user:\n```bash psql -U nombre_usuario -d nombre_base_de_datos ``` You will be asked for the user\u0026rsquo;s password. If you can access the database, the configuration was successful.\n#4. Creation and Consultation of a Table\nCreate a new table * *: Once inside the PostgreSQL console with the new user, create a new table. For example, for a table of football equipment:\n```sql CREATE TABLE equipos ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, nombre VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, titulos INT NOT NULL ); ``` Insert data in the table * *: Insert some test data into the created table:\n```sql INSERT INTO equipos (nombre, titulos) VALUES ('Real Madrid', 15), ('Barcelona', 5); ``` See the data in the table * *: Conducts a consultation to verify that the data have been correctly inserted:\n```sql SELECT * FROM equipos; ``` The expected exit should be:\n```plaintext id | nombre | titulos ----+--------------+--------- 1 | Real Madrid | 15 2 | Barcelona | 5 ``` With these steps, you have installed PostgreSQL, created a user and database, and performed basic tests to ensure that everything works properly.

It establishes a connection in 100 milliseconds, while OpenVPN takes 8 milliseconds. In some tests, WireGuard proved to be 58% faster than OpenVPN. In ideal circumstances, its speed exceeded 500 mbps.\nWireGuard is the fastest protocol due to many factors. These include:\nIts light code makes it intrinsically the fastest protocol. WireGuard also supports multithreatening - processing data using many CPU cores simultaneously - and uses a faster encryption method. In addition, WireGuard is good at using the available bandwidth and operates completely in the kernel space. To avoid censorship, OpenVPN is better than WireGuard. Why? Because the OpenVPN protocol can work on the layers of the UPD and TCP Protocol.\nUDP is faster, while TCP is reliable. TCP can avoid censorship using port 443, the same port that HTTPS uses. Thanks to TCP, OpenVPN avoids censorship of strict countries such as China and Russia. In some cases, an advanced deep inspection can detect OpenVPN. But for these cases, safety experts recommend using the Scramble within the advanced protocol configuration to add another layer of protection to the VPN traffic.\nOn the other hand, WireGuard only uses the UDP layer to transport data. And the main purpose of UDP is to transport data at high speed, not to evade censorship. This makes it easy to detect. In addition, it is susceptible to deep inspection of packages.\nOpenVPN is safe if properly configured. This protocol has no known security vulnerabilities, and its code has been audited many times. In addition, it has many encryption and authentication algorithms. When there is some security vulnerability in the algorithm, then OpenVPN can immediately configure another thing.\nIn terms of security cases, WireGuard has also gained a good reputation. It is safe and uses the latest cryptography. Your code is short and easy to audit. In addition, WireGuard has a fixed set of algorithms and encryption. When some vulnerability is found, all end points are updated to a new version, which ensures that no one reuses unsafe code.\n","date":"March 28, 2024","hero":"/images/vpn/wire_ovpn.png","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/vpn/comparativa_ovpn_wire/comparativa_ovpn_wire/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/vpn/comparativa_ovpn_wire/img/Pastedimage20240114150833.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal of this post is to compare the different VPNs software most used by seeing which is faster, for which we will support in speed test using iperf3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[NOTE]\nThe comparative part of the posts in this section in which we mount each type of VPN.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"speed-without-vpn\"\u003eSpeed without VPN\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m gonna start by comparing the speeds of these 2 systems, using iperf3.

We will then test it on the Apache and Nginx web servers.\nCreate the certifying authority Step 1: Creating directories and files\nThe first step will be to generate a directory in which you will locate your certification authority, in order to maintain an organization at all times. The directory name will be CA /. In turn, you have to generate several subdirectories within it:\ncertsdb: The signed certificates shall be stored in that directory. certreqs: In that directory, the certificate signature application files (CSR) shall be stored. crl: The list of certificates that have been revoked (CRL) shall be stored in that directory. private: The private key of the certifying authority shall be stored in this directory. debian@javiercrucesCA:~$ sudo mkdir /CA debian@javiercrucesCA:~$ cd !$ debian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo mkdir certsdb certreqs crl private debian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo chmod 700 private/ debian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo touch index.txt Once the directories are generated, move into the father CA / directory. When you are within it, you list the content in a graphic way so you can appreciate that everything has been generated correctly, making use of tree. You\u0026rsquo;ll see that the 4 directories have been properly generated. Before continuing it is recommended to change the permissions to 700 to the private directory /, as it will contain the private key of the CA and we are interested that only the owner has access to it. In addition, we will need in the current directory a file that will act as a database for existing index.txt name certificates\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo tree -p [drwxr-xr-x] . ├── [drwxr-xr-x] certreqs ├── [drwxr-xr-x] certsdb ├── [drwxr-xr-x] crl ├── [-rw-r--r--] index.txt └── [drwx------] private 5 directories, 1 file debian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ Step 2: Openssl configuration file The most likely is that you want to use an openssl configuration file other than that of our machine, so try to make the certifying authority as isolated as possible from it, so make a copy of your native configuration file and adapt it to your needs. This file is normally found in / usr / lib / ssl / openssl.cnf, although it may also be in / etc / openssl.cnf or in / usr / share / ssl / openssl.cnf, you will have to copy it to the current directory and modify it with a text editor.\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo cp /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf ./ debian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ ls -l total 32 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan 8 19:22 certreqs drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan 8 19:22 certsdb drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan 8 19:22 crl -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jan 8 19:23 index.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 12332 Jan 8 19:26 openssl.cnf drwx------ 2 root root 4096 Jan 8 19:22 private Within it, appropriate adaptations must be made to make use of the directories previously generated, as well as to indicate certain basic information about the certifying authority, which your partner must know, as it will be requested at the time of the generation of the certificate signature application file. The amendments to be made are as follows:\ndir = / root / CA certs = $dir / certsdb new _ certs _ dir = $certs\n[ CA_default ] dir = /CA # Where everything is kept certs = $dir/certsdb # Where the issued certs are kept crl_dir = $dir/crl # Where the issued crl are kept database = $dir/index.txt # database index file. #unique_subject = no # Set to \u0026#39;no\u0026#39; to allow creation of # several certs with same subject. new_certs_dir = $certs # default place for new certs. countryName _ default = EN stateOrProvinceName _ default = Sevilla localityName _ default = Two Sisters 0.organizationName _ default = IES Gonzalo Nazareno organization\n[ req_distinguished_name ] countryName = Country Name (2 letter code) countryName_default = ES countryName_min = 2 countryName_max = 2 stateOrProvinceName = State or Province Name (full name) stateOrProvinceName_default = Sevilla localityName = Dos Hermanas 0.organizationName = Organization Name (eg, company) 0.organizationName_default = IES Gonzalo Nazareno #we can do this but it is not needed normally :-) #1.organizationName = Second Organization Name (eg, company) #1.organizationName_default = World Wide Web Pty Ltd organizationalUnitName = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) organizationalUnitName_default = Informatica #challenge #challenge #challenge #unstructural\n[ req_attributes ] challengePassword = A challenge password challengePassword_min = 4 challengePassword_max = 20 unstructuredName = An optional company name Step 3: Creation and signature of our own certificate After that, you will have everything ready to generate your key pair and a certificate signature application file that you will then self-sign, running the command for:\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout private/cakey.pem -out careq.pem -config ./openssl.cnf Enter PEM pass phrase: Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: ----- You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.

The last two fields are not generic, so we must fill them out on a case-by-case basis. After that, we will be able to proceed with the self-signing of the certificate, which we will then have to provide to customers to include in their list of CA certificates, so that they are not shown the warning when using HTTPS. As I mentioned earlier, in a real situation, this process is usually carried out by companies with a certain reputation whose certificate is imported by default in the browsers. To do this, run the command:\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo openssl ca -create_serial -out cacert.pem -days 365 -keyfile private/cakey.pem -selfsign -extensions v3_ca -config ./openssl.cnf -infiles careq.pem Using configuration from ./openssl.cnf Enter pass phrase for private/cakey.pem: Check that the request matches the signature Signature ok Certificate Details: Serial Number: 74:1e:8a:f8:24:45:14:9e:28:f1:83:04:7c:7d:6c:0f:5f:3b:ac:f2 Validity Not Before: Jan 8 19:57:17 2024 GMT Not After : Jan 7 19:57:17 2025 GMT Subject: countryName = ES stateOrProvinceName = Sevilla organizationName = IES Gonzalo Nazareno organizationalUnitName = Informatica commonName = javiercruces.iesgn.org emailAddress = javierasping@gmail.com X509v3 extensions: X509v3 Subject Key Identifier: E3:9C:A3:CF:0E:33:EB:83:45:40:00:9B:04:4A:A9:9B:C8:8C:A9:62 X509v3 Authority Key Identifier: E3:9C:A3:CF:0E:33:EB:83:45:40:00:9B:04:4A:A9:9B:C8:8C:A9:62 X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical CA:TRUE Certificate is to be certified until Jan 7 19:57:17 2025 GMT (365 days) Sign the certificate?

As you can see at the output of the command, we have been asked to make sure that even if the private key reached bad hands, they cannot make fraudulent signatures. In addition, before signing the certificate, we have been shown all the information concerning the certificate, and we have been asked for confirmation. To verify that the certificate of the certifying authority is contained in the current directory, list the content of the certificate and check that, in fact, there is a cact.pem file that is the result of signing the application file of the Careq.pem. certificate.\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo tree . ├── cacert.pem ├── careq.pem ├── certreqs ├── certsdb │ └── 741E8AF82445149E28F183047C7D6C0F5F3BACF2.pem ├── crl ├── index.txt ├── index.txt.attr ├── index.txt.old ├── openssl.cnf ├── private │ └── cakey.pem └── serial 5 directories, 9 files debian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ Step 4: Signature of licence applications It is all ready to proceed to sign the certificate for your partner\u0026rsquo;s server, so you must place your certificate signature application file within certreqs /, which is where they should be located.\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:~$ sudo ls -l /CA/certreqs/ total 4 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1785 Jan 11 10:00 peperc.csr You can proceed to sign it, using the command:\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -extensions v3_req -days 3650 -notext -md sha256 -in certreqs/peperc.csr -out certsdb/pepe.csr.pem Using configuration from openssl.cnf Enter pass phrase for /CA/private/cakey.pem: Check that the request matches the signature Signature ok Certificate Details: Serial Number: 74:1e:8a:f8:24:45:14:9e:28:f1:83:04:7c:7d:6c:0f:5f:3b:ac:f3 Validity Not Before: Jan 11 10:01:58 2024 GMT Not After : Jan 8 10:01:58 2034 GMT Subject: countryName = ES stateOrProvinceName = Sevilla organizationName = IES Gonzalo Nazareno commonName = pfoter15 emailAddress = pepepfoter15@gmail.com X509v3 extensions: X509v3 Basic Constraints: CA:FALSE X509v3 Key Usage: Digital Signature, Non Repudiation, Key Encipherment Certificate is to be certified until Jan 8 10:01:58 2034 GMT (3650 days) Sign the certificate?

So far your share has come, as only the certsdb / nombre.crt file, which is its signed certificate, together with the certificate of the certifying authority, which contains the public key, would be allowed to be sent to your partner, in order to be able to verify that signature on its certificate, the name of cact.pem. Finally, you will show the content of the index.txt file, which is a kind of flat text database with information on the certificates signed by the certifying authority. Within it, we find basic information corresponding to the two signed certificates: that of the certification authority itself and that of our partner, in addition to its current state of validity.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to send and bring me from the instance of pepe the different files, he has configured my public key so that I can connect:\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:~$ scp javiercd.csr 172.22.200.113:/home/debian/ javiercd.csr 100% 1886 839.4KB/s 00:00 debian@javiercrucesCA:~$ scp 172.22.200.113:/home/debian/peperc.csr ./ peperc.csr 100% 1785 432.6KB/s 00:00 -- Le envio su certificado firmado debian@javiercrucesCA:~$ scp 172.22.200.113:/CA/certsdb/pepe.csr.pem pepe.csr.pem 100% 1785 432.6KB/s 00:00 debian@javiercrucesCA:~$ scp /CA/cacert.pem 172.22.200.113:/home/debian/pub_javi.pem cacert.pem 100% 7429 582.6KB/s 00:00 debian@javiercrucesCA:~$ scp 172.22.200.113:/CA/cacert.pem ./pub_pepe.pem cacert.pem 100% 7389 1.2MB/s 00:00 Task 2: Configure HTTPS Step 1: Key creation and certificate application. The first thing you have to do is create a certificate signature application (CSR or Certificate Signing Request) and get it to your partner. In this case, let\u0026rsquo;s do it with openssl, but it could be done with other multiple software options.\nTo create a certificate signature application, we must first have a private key that will be associated with it, so we will generate a 4096 bit RSA private key, which will be stored in /etc/ssl/private/, running the command for it:\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:~$ sudo openssl genrsa 4096 \u0026gt; javiercd.key debian@javiercrucesCA:~$ sudo mv javiercd.key /etc/ssl/private/ Once generated, we will change the permissions of it to 400, so that only the owner can read the content, as it is a private key. This step is not mandatory but is recommended for safety. Write the command necessary for it.\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:~$ sudo chmod 400 /etc/ssl/private/javiercd.key After that, we will create a .csr file of application for a certificate signature to be signed by the certifying authority (CA) created by our partner. This file does not contain confidential information, so it will not import the route where we store it or the assigned permits. In my case, I will store it in the current directory, running the openssl req command, with the options:\nnew: We indicate that the creation of the application for a certificate is interactive, as it will ask for certain parameters. key: We indicate the private key to associate with this application for a certificate. In this case, the one generated in the previous step, /etc/ssl/private/tunombre.key. out: We specify where the certificate signature application will be stored. In this case, in the current directory, with the name tunombre.csr. During the execution, you will ask us for a series of values to identify the certificate, which we will have to fill in according to the configuration we have made in the certification unit.\nThis information will have to be given to us by the certifying authority, except for the last two values, which in the case of the Common Name, you will put the FQDN of the web on which we want to configure HTTPS. In addition, you will need to enter your email in the Email Address section.\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -extensions v3_req -days 3650 -notext -md sha256 -in certreqs/peperc.csr -out certsdb/pepe.csr.pem Using configuration from openssl.cnf Enter pass phrase for /CA/private/cakey.pem: Check that the request matches the signature Signature ok Certificate Details: Serial Number: 74:1e:8a:f8:24:45:14:9e:28:f1:83:04:7c:7d:6c:0f:5f:3b:ac:f3 Validity Not Before: Jan 11 10:01:58 2024 GMT Not After : Jan 8 10:01:58 2034 GMT Subject: countryName = ES stateOrProvinceName = Sevilla organizationName = IES Gonzalo Nazareno commonName = pfoter15 emailAddress = pepepfoter15@gmail.com X509v3 extensions: X509v3 Basic Constraints: CA:FALSE X509v3 Key Usage: Digital Signature, Non Repudiation, Key Encipherment Certificate is to be certified until Jan 8 10:01:58 2034 GMT (3650 days) Sign the certificate? [y/n]:y 1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]y Write out database with 1 new entries Database updated To verify that the signature request file has been correctly generated, list the content of the current directory.

Store both files in /etc/ssl/certs/ and list the contents of that directory.\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:~$ sudo mv javiercd.csr.pem /etc/ssl/certs/ debian@javiercrucesCA:~$ sudo mv pub_pepe.pem /etc/ssl/certs There must be a file of the name tunombre.crt that is the result of the signature of the application for signature of the certificate that we have previously sent you, and another of the name cact.pem, which is the certificate of the certifying authority, with which the signature of the certifying authority on that certificate of the server will then be checked.\ndebian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo ls -l /etc/ssl/certs | grep javi -rw-r--r-- 1 debian debian 2175 Jan 11 10:05 javiercd.csr.pem debian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo ls -l /etc/ssl/certs | grep pepe -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7389 Jan 11 11:24 pub_pepe.pem debian@javiercrucesCA:/CA$ sudo ls -l /etc/ssl/private/ total 8 -r-------- 1 debian debian 3272 Jan 11 09:37 javiercd.key Step 3: Apache configuration As apache2 included a default VirtualHost for incoming requests by port 80 (HTTP), it contains a default one for incoming requests by port 443 (HTTPS), by name default-ssl, which by default is disabled, so we will proceed to modify it taking into account the following directives:\nServerName: As in the previous VirtualHost, we will have to indicate the domain name through which we will access the server. SSLEngine: Activates the SSL engine, necessary to make use of HTTPS, so its value should be on. SSLCertificateFile: We indicate the route of the server certificate signed by the CA. In this case, / etc / ssl / certs / tunombre.crt. SSLCertificateKeyFile: We indicate the route of the private key associated with the server certificate. In this case, / etc / ssl / private / tunombre.key. SSLCACertificateFile: We indicate the route of the CA certificate with which we will check the signature of our certificate.

Therefore, I decided to establish an equivalence between the different actions I have carried out during practice and to compare them with their counterpart in the terminal.\n[NOTE] In this post I do a small summary of the equivalencies between the GUI and the CLI of Fortinet that I have used in the 2 Fortinet firewall posts.\nConfigure an interface As we already have the set-up firewall we have 2 options when viewing the configuration of a particular interface.\nSee the configuration of all interfaces:\nshow system interface Or specify a particular one:\nshow system interface port1 If we look at the configuration of the three interfaces I have established during practice, we can note that the syntax is very simple. Virtually, even without prior knowledge of the subject, it is easy to understand.\nFTG # show system interface config system interface edit \u0026#34;port1\u0026#34; set vdom \u0026#34;root\u0026#34; set ip 192.168.122.77 255.255.255.0 set allowaccess https http fgfm set type physical set alias \u0026#34;WAN\u0026#34; set lldp-reception enable set role wan set snmp-index 1 next edit \u0026#34;port2\u0026#34; set vdom \u0026#34;root\u0026#34; set ip 192.168.100.1 255.255.255.0 set allowaccess ping https ssh http fgfm set type physical set alias \u0026#34;LAN\u0026#34; set device-identification enable set lldp-transmission enable set monitor-bandwidth enable set role lan set snmp-index 2 next edit \u0026#34;port3\u0026#34; set vdom \u0026#34;root\u0026#34; set ip 192.168.200.1 255.255.255.0 set type physical set alias \u0026#34;DMZ\u0026#34; set device-identification enable set lldp-transmission enable set role lan set snmp-index 3 next As you can see in the port 1 interface that corresponds to the WAN, previously disable the access to configure it from this interface, but for comfort I have left it enabled to use my laptop\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nA configuration that may interest us is to set up a DHCP interface, in my case I will do it in port 4:\n#Accedemos al modo de configuración FTG # config system interface #Seleccionamos la interfaz 4 FTG (interface) # edit \u0026#34;port4\u0026#34; #La ponemos en modo DHCP FTG (port4) # set mode dhcp #Salimos del modo de configuración FTG (port4) # end Now if we list the interface configuration, the change will have been applied:\nFTG # show system interface port4 config system interface edit \u0026#34;port4\u0026#34; set vdom \u0026#34;root\u0026#34; set mode dhcp set type physical set snmp-index 4 next end At this point, we note that the commands we have used match those that the system shows when listing the configuration.\nNow, what we\u0026rsquo;re interested in is knowing the IP address of our interface. If we want to list all the assigned IP addresses, we simply do not specify the interface name. In my case, I am interested to know the IP address of the port interface 4:\nFTG # get system interface physical port4 == [onboard] ==[port4] mode: dhcp ip: 192.168.122.121 255.255.255.0 ipv6: ::/0 status: up speed: 1000Mbps (Duplex: full) FEC: none FEC_cap: none This is the basic thing we need to start setting up the interfaces. I leave you a [link] (https: / / docs.fortinet.com / document / fortigate / 7.0.0 / cli-reference / 10620 / config-system-interface) to the official documentation where it explains all the details.\nPolicies The next thing we have done in practice is to create rules from the CLI, so I will start by listing the existing rules, remember that in the test version we have a limit of 10 simultaneous rules so I have removed some rules during the performance of it.\nTo make the output more legible we will see a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; rule and a DNAT rule to compare them:\nFTG # show firewall policy config firewall policy edit 1 set name \u0026#34;LAN_WAN_SSH\u0026#34; set uuid 57bba290-e881-51ee-3bbe-3ba5903773ed set srcintf \u0026#34;port2\u0026#34; set dstintf \u0026#34;port1\u0026#34; set action accept set srcaddr \u0026#34;all\u0026#34; set dstaddr \u0026#34;all\u0026#34; set schedule \u0026#34;always\u0026#34; set service \u0026#34;SSH\u0026#34; set nat enable next edit 5 set name \u0026#34;WAN_LAN_DNAT_SSH\u0026#34; set uuid bdd84292-e884-51ee-a5d3-20eabb2fd433 set srcintf \u0026#34;port1\u0026#34; set dstintf \u0026#34;port2\u0026#34; set action accept set srcaddr \u0026#34;all\u0026#34; set dstaddr \u0026#34;DNAT_SSH\u0026#34; set schedule \u0026#34;always\u0026#34; set service \u0026#34;SSH\u0026#34; set utm-status enable set ssl-ssh-profile \u0026#34;certificate-inspection\u0026#34; set ips-sensor \u0026#34;block_xmas\u0026#34; set nat enable next We see that the output is quite clear, if we stop to see the common parameters:\nname: Name we want to give to the rule. UUID: A unique identifier that automatically assigns the FW to each rule. srcintf: Home interface (The way the traffic enters) dstantf: Home interface (From where the traffic enters) action: What action we want you to make the rule accept - 124; deny. srcaddr: address of origin dstaddr: Address of destination schedule: Regulation programming, in case it is a temporary rule this will only be active for a certain time. service: Service name (assigned to a port number) nat: If we want the rule to make SNAT. This would be the basic syntax of each rule as you see between a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; rule and one of DNAT the only thing that changes is the traffic address and the target IP that on this device is a virtual IP.\nIf we want to delete a rule, we will do the following:\n#Accedemos al modo de configuracion de las politicas de seguridad FTG # config firewall policy #Borraremos la regla segun el id de la misma FTG (policy) # delete 2 #Salimos de la configuracion FTG (policy) # end To add a new rule, the syntax is similar to when we list the rules, but we need to specify an ID number when creating it. You should know the number of the last rule you added. If you don\u0026rsquo;t indicate a number, a new rule will not be created.\nFTG#config firewall policy FTG (policy) # edit 12 new entry \u0026#39;12\u0026#39; added FTG (12) # set name \u0026#34;LAN_WAN_DNS\u0026#34; FTG (12) # set srcintf \u0026#34;port2\u0026#34; FTG (12) # set dstintf \u0026#34;port1\u0026#34; FTG (12) # set action accept FTG (12) # set srcaddr \u0026#34;all\u0026#34; FTG (12) # set dstaddr \u0026#34;Google_DNS\u0026#34; FTG (12) # set schedule \u0026#34;always\u0026#34; FTG (12) # set service \u0026#34;DNS\u0026#34; FTG (12) # set nat enable FTG (12) # next FTG (policy) # end There are many more options that I ignore that have not been necessary to use in practice, I leave you a link to the official documentation where details all the different options.\nServices Services are objects that store a number or set of ports that you will later use when creating rules. Although these devices come with the most common manufacturing services, it is often necessary that we create a new one according to our needs.\nAs with the previous listing commands, we can list all the services or one in particular:\nFTG # show firewall service custom config firewall service custom edit \u0026#34;DNS\u0026#34; set category \u0026#34;Network Services\u0026#34; set tcp-portrange 53 set udp-portrange 53 next edit \u0026#34;HTTP\u0026#34; set category \u0026#34;Web Access\u0026#34; set tcp-portrange 80 next edit \u0026#34;HTTPS\u0026#34; set category \u0026#34;Web Access\u0026#34; set tcp-portrange 443 next FTG # show firewall service custom SSH_2222 config firewall service custom edit \u0026#34;SSH_2222\u0026#34; set category \u0026#34;Remote Access\u0026#34; set tcp-portrange 2222 next end To delete a service, we will follow the following steps:\n#Accedemos a la configuración de los servicios FTG # config firewall service custom #Borramos el servicio indicando el nombre FTG (custom) # delete SSH_2222 #Salimos del modo de configuración FTG (custom) # end If we want to create it, we will follow the following steps:\n#Accedemos a la configuración de los servicios FTG # config firewall service custom #Le asignamos un nombre FTG (custom) # edit SSH_2222 #Opcionalmente lo añadimos a una categoria FTG (SSH_2222) # set category \u0026#34;Remote Access\u0026#34; #Indicamos los puertos que hace referencia al mismo FTG (SSH_2222) # set tcp-portrange 2222 #Guardamos y salimos del modo de confuguración FTG (SSH_2222) # next FTG (custom) # end I leave you a [link] (https: / / docs.fortinet.com / document / fortigate / 7.0.0 / ngfw-deployment / 546227 / creating-service-objects) to the official documentation concerning the services where you explain in detail all the options of the services.\nVirtual PIs The VIPs are used to map external IP addresses to internal IP addresses. This is also called DNAT, where the destination of a package is being sent to a different address.\nStatic VIP are commonly used to map public IP addresses to resources behind the FortiGate that use private IP addresses. A static VIP one by one is when the entire range of ports is mapped. A port forwarding VIP is when the mapping is set up in a specific port or port range.\nIf we want to list the different virtual PIs we have we will use the following command, if we only want to list one in particular we will indicate its name:\nFTG # show firewall vip config firewall vip edit \u0026#34;DNAT_POSTFIX\u0026#34; set uuid a343ec4a-e881-51ee-0ec1-ad73db3ff299 set service \u0026#34;SMTP\u0026#34; set extip 192.168.100.1 set mappedip \u0026#34;192.168.200.2\u0026#34; set extintf \u0026#34;port2\u0026#34; next edit \u0026#34;DNAT_SSH\u0026#34; set uuid a2b62344-e884-51ee-1a11-8946fda2bd91 set service \u0026#34;SSH_2222\u0026#34; set extip 192.168.122.77 set mappedip \u0026#34;192.168.100.2\u0026#34; set extintf \u0026#34;port1\u0026#34; set portforward enable set mappedport 22 next FTG # show firewall vip DNAT_HELA_WEB config firewall vip edit \u0026#34;DNAT_HELA_WEB\u0026#34; set uuid a417a8f8-edf6-51ee-f601-43829c174966 set service \u0026#34;HTTP\u0026#34; set extip 192.168.122.77 set mappedip \u0026#34;192.168.200.2\u0026#34; set extintf \u0026#34;port1\u0026#34; next end In case we want to remove one of these virtual PIs, we will follow the following steps:\n#Accedemos al modo de configuración FTG # config firewall vip #Borramos la IP virtual indicando su nombre FTG (vip) # delete DNAT_HELA_WEB #Salimos del modo de configuración FTG (vip) # end On the other hand to create one of these, as we have done from the GUI we will follow the following steps:\n#Accedemos al modo de configuración FTG # config firewall vip #Le asignamos el nombre que deseemos FTG (vip) # edit DNAT_HELA_WEB #Indicamos opcionalmente sobre el servicio que sera usado esta IP virtual FTG (DNAT_HELA_WEB) # set service \u0026#34;HTTP\u0026#34; #Indicamos la Ip externa FTG (DNAT_HELA_WEB) # set extip 192.168.122.77 #Indicamos la Ip interna FTG (DNAT_HELA_WEB) # set mappedip \u0026#34;192.168.200.2\u0026#34; #Indicamos la interfaz externa FTG (DNAT_HELA_WEB) # set extintf \u0026#34;port1\u0026#34; #Guardamos y salimos FTG (DNAT_HELA_WEB) # next FTG (vip) # end Virtual IP have more configuration parameters that I have not used in practice, I leave you a [link] (https: / / docs.fortinet.com / document / fortigate / 7.0.9 / administration-guide / 510402 / static-virtual-ips) to the official documentation where you detail all the settings that we can access with them.\nStatic routes Our device needs to know where to send the traffic, for this there are static routes.\nTo list the routes that our firewall has set up, we will use the following command:\nFTG # show router static config router static edit 1 set gateway 192.168.122.1 set device \u0026#34;port1\u0026#34; next end As we have done before, if we want to remove this default route we will follow the following steps:\nFTG # config router static FTG (static) # delete 1 FTG (static) # end If we want to add a route, you can use this example:\nFTG # config router static FTG (static) # edit 1 #El siguiete salto o puerta de enlace FTG (1) # set gateway 192.168.122.1 #La interfaz por donde saldra el trafico FTG (1) # set device \u0026#34;port1\u0026#34; FTG (1) # next FTG (static) # end ","date":"March 28, 2024","hero":"/images/cortafuegos/fortinet_cli.png","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/cortafuegos/fortinet_cli/fortinet_cli/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"equivalence-from-gui-to-cli\"\u003eEquivalence from GUI to CLI\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, I started the practice using the command line (CLI), however, I found it more comfortable to do it from the graphic interface.

I have used version 7.0.9-1 of FortiGate, as the higher versions bring some restrictions. You can download the image from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ 1VGmeLN5inkWNNNUsIvq9ewGUzJLTLkiM).\nFirewall start-up FortiGate devices are made with the IP 192.168.1.99 / 24, as I am from GNS3 do not need to connect to this interface with a device and change the configuration. Since I can do it from the console.\nBy default through that port is enabled the administration by http, https, ssh and telnet.\nIn my case I will connect from the console, change your hostname and configure port 1 to take IP for DHCP.\nThe default user is admin and the blank password. When we first log in, it will force us to change it:\nFortiGate-VM64-KVM login: admin Password: You are forced to change your password. Please input a new password. New Password: Confirm Password: Welcome! The first thing I\u0026rsquo;ll do is change your hostname, as you see it is similar to swan as we have a configuration mode:\nFortiGate-VM64-KVM # conf sys global FortiGate-VM64-KVM (global) # set hostname FGT FortiGate-VM64-KVM (global) # end Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to set up port 1 by DHCP so that from client 2 you can set it up without having to manually change the IP of it. In addition I will set up the access by http and https to be able to configure it from a browser:\nFGT # show system interface port1 config system interface edit \u0026#34;port1\u0026#34; set vdom \u0026#34;root\u0026#34; set mode dhcp set allowaccess ping https ssh http fgfm set type physical set snmp-index 1 next end Now let\u0026rsquo;s see the IP that the DHCP has assigned you with the following command:\nFGT # get system interface == [ port1 ] name: port1 mode: dhcp ip: 192.168.122.77 255.255.255.0 status: up netbios-forward: disable type: physical ring-rx: 0 ring-tx: 0 netflow-sampler: disable sflow-sampler: disable src-check: enable explicit-web-proxy: disable explicit-ftp-proxy: disable proxy-captive-portal: disable mtu-override: disable wccp: disable drop-overlapped-fragment: disable drop-fragment: disable Now from any machine that has access to the \u0026rsquo;external\u0026rsquo; network we can connect to the FW:\nWhen you log in you will see a panel with general information about the device status:\nLAN Network Configuration\nAs you have seen in the topology image, the LAN network is connected to port 2. We will therefore proceed to set it up.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go to Network \u0026gt; Interfaces, select port 2 and click to edit in the top bar:\nOnce inside the interface configuration screen, you can customize the port by assigning an alias. In addition, to facilitate future management, I have assigned the LAN role to the port2, indicating that it will be used for a local network. I have subsequently configured the IP address of it, assigning it to the 192.168.100.1 / 24. In addition, I have created an object with that IP, which will facilitate the reference to this IP address in future settings, eliminating the need to remember the IP.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s continue with the interface configuration. From the LAN network, where we will be most of the time, I will allow access via HTTPS and SSH to configure the FortiGate. I\u0026rsquo;ll also let you respond to the pings to ensure connectivity with it. In addition, each interface can be a DHCP server, so I will set you one for the LAN. Finally, I will activate the option to detect devices, so I will have control over who is connected to the network.\nOnce you set up the administrative access from the LAN, I will remove the administrative access from the port 1 interface as this serious Internet (WAN).\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll change the ROL to WAN and take away administrative access:\nIf you remember earlier we marked the Device connection box in the LAN interface, if we want to see the devices connected to this network we access Security Fabric \u0026gt; Asset Identify Center:\nFor later sections, as I will perform the practice of node firewall, it is interesting to create an object with that host. So you don\u0026rsquo;t need to remember your IP:\nAlthough I have not mentioned anything above, the default policy of these devices is DROP in all directions:\nNow we are going to create a new policy that allows for the traffic from the LAN to the Internet (WAN) in any direction. This policy would be similar to those we have at home, where we can access any website. In addition, from here we can say that you do SNAT, which will allow us to navigate the Internet. We can also configure to which interface this SNAT will be made.\nTo end the initial configuration, we will create the default route to get out on the Internet. For this we will go to Network \u0026gt; Static Routes:\nOnce this policy has been implemented, we can start the practice, we can also access the Internet from customer 1:\nFirewall rules To begin with, I will deactivate the previous policy, and at the end of it will remove the tic that activates it:\nIt is thus inactive:\nLocal network equipment should be able to have an external connection. To configure the SNAT on FortiGate devices, it is a little different since in every rule we will allow we will have to mark the box if we want to do NAT.\nWe can also specify all possible options that we can think of, in my case I will leave this section unactivated and I will do it in the following rules. The image you see below is to indicate where it would be activated. We can also indicate why we want the traffic out. This is useful if we have two or more Internet outputs to make a load rocker.\nOnce here within the interface configuration we tell you that the interface is NAT type, we can also tell you not to do PAT.\nWe allowed to do ping from the LAN to the firewall machine. In these devices it would not be a rule as such, but this particular option is indicated from the administrative access option of the interface:\nOnce applied, if we go to client 1 we can do ping to the firewall:\nAllows to make ssh connections from LAN equipment We will create the rule that allows SSH traffic, here at the source we can put either the cliente1 (we create the object in the preparation of the stage) or directly put all at the origin:\nAlthough I currently have only one client in my scheme, stick to the statement if I want ALL LAN customers to make ssh at source I have to allow all:\nAs I explained in paragraph a of the practice, in this type of device we have to tell you whether we want the rule to be NAT-type to do SNAT or not.\nOnce the rule is applied, we can connect by ssh from the cliente1:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s make sure the rule has hits:\nAllows navigation on LAN network For this we will create 2 rules for the LAN network. One that allows DNS and another to allow HTTPS and HTTP traffic, in addition to both rules it will be necessary to indicate that it is done NAT.\nAs you have fixed, I have not indicated the port number, but that these devices have objects called services in which the port numbers of these are stored. We can create the objects we want and customize the existing ones according to our needs.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check that we can navigate on client 1:\nNeedless to say, of course we can do a dig, with the current rule we can do it to any DNS server:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check that we have hits in the rules:\nInstall a post server on the LAN machine. It allows access from the outside and from the firewall to the post server. To prove it you can run a telnet to port 25 tcp. As we are currently allowed to navigation only by https it is essential that the machine repositories are configured we can install packages on our client, so we will install postfix:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install postfix -y Now we\u0026rsquo;re gonna set up the first DNAT rule we\u0026rsquo;re gonna have on stage. To do this we will have to create a virtual IP and tell you which is the external IP (WAN) and the IP where we are going to do the DNAT (LAN).\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add the rule in our policy, in the destination of the rule we will indicate the virtual IP that we just created and we indicate the SMTP service that has the 25 TCP port configured:\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s check that from an external client, as is Client 2 we can access Customer 1:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check that the rule we just created has hits:\nAllows to make ssh connections from outside to the LAN To do this, we will have to recreate a new virtual IP as it previously specified that this IP was only used for the SMTP protocol. So I\u0026rsquo;m gonna create a new one:\nOnce the new virtual IP is created for the ssh, we will create the DNAT rule:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try our new rule from client 2:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check the hits of our new rule:\n# # Modifies the previous rule, so that when we access from the outside by ssh we have to connect to port 2222, although the ssh server is configured to access by port 22. To do this we will have to generate a new service that is in port 2222:\nNow we are going to modify our virtual IP by modifying the service by the new one we have created with the 2222 port and we will make a port forweding to the 22 port:\nOnce this has been done, we can access ssh using the 2222 port and redirect us to 22. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to change the rules, only with this we can access:\nWe will check the hits of the rules, plus in the Virtual IP section we also have a hit counter:\nIt allows DNS queries from the LAN only to the 8.8.8.8 server. Check that you can\u0026rsquo;t make a dig @ 1.1.1.1. For this we will modify the rule that allows DNS queries and we will indicate that the destination is only 8.8.8.8.\nFirst we will need to create a new object with the Google DNS server IP:\nNow we change the rule and put this object as a destination:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check the change of the rule, so we can only do dns consultations at 8.8.8.8:\nWe can check that the hits have gone up:\nAllows LAN equipment to browse the Internet, except for the www.realbetisbalompie.es page These new generation firewalls bring a series of services that filter us at the application level that allows us to detect key words to filter the content (drugs, pornography, weapons\u0026hellip;), in this firewall the filtering by key words is a payment service, you have to pay a license. It also allows us to create filters to block certain web pages, which in this case is free.\nThe first thing is to create our web _ filter policy:\nAnd we add in it a new filter per URL:\nWe now turn to the rule that allows us to traffic https and in security we add the web filter we have just created:\nTo the left I will access from the browser of my physical machine and I can access the page of the evil one, however if I access from client 1 the firewall does not let us access:\nIf we access FortiView Destinations we can see the pages that our filter has blocked:\n","date":"March 28, 2024","hero":"/images/cortafuegos/fortinet1.png","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/cortafuegos/fortinet_uno/fortinet_uno/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBefore you start the practice, the scenario you see in the practice is as similar as I can ride to the original practice.

To this end, I have transformed client 1 into Odin, and added Thor and Loki as virtual machines instead of containers on the LAN network. I have also created a new network called DMZ, in which will be the Hela machine.\nSince I have transformed the previous scenario into this new one, we have some rules created earlier. Therefore, I will remove from the statement those that are already created, such as making SSH to Odin from port 2222, but with the service listening in the 22.\nIn addition, we are now going to make DHCP reservations to have the IP of the new machines controlled.\nIn addition to not counting on the services mounted on the old stage in Opsentack and for the rules of the enunciation I will mount the minimum to make the rules work.\nThroughout this practice I will explain to you that by how the topology of the network is mounted, all of the LAN network can communicate with each other without the need to pass through the firewall. So in some exercises I\u0026rsquo;ll skip the part about making Loki and Thor communicate with Odin. In addition I will not mount the DNS or LDAP server as the rules of DNAT are quite simple and along the practice several exercises of doing DNAT between the different networks appear. Instead I will add VPN at the end of it as I see it more interesting than repeating the same rules by changing the service.\nStage preparation The first thing I will do is create a new network in port 3, which corresponds to the DMZ network.\nAs you will see in the image below I have selected the role to be LAN, to allow me to have a DHCP server on that network.

This rule cannot be realized because by having a switch by interconnecting the devices, the traffic does not pass through the firewall so we cannot apply rules in the firewall to prevent local traffic.\nYou see, even if he believes the rule, in the firewall, this one will not be immutated:\nYou see that for example if I connect from loki or thor I can get to odin:\ndebian@loki:~$ ssh osboxes@192.168.100.2 osboxes@192.168.100.2\u0026#39;s password: Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-25-generic x86_64) * Documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com * Management: https://landscape.canonical.com * Support: https://ubuntu.com/advantage 560 updates can be applied immediately. 339 of these updates are standard security updates.

Generation of the shared key Once you have configured both machines, it is necessary to agree on the use of a shared key called PSK (Pre-Shared Key). You can generate a PSK randomly to improve connection security. Here is an example of how to generate a random key:\ndebian@servidor1:~$ head -c 24 /dev/urandom | base64 cXPeOAcKIVszFHp68CcGX6dLXcWcbrIl Now in the / etc / ipsec.secrets file we will configure the PSK key, which at both ends has to be the same:\ndebian@servidor1:~$ sudo cat /etc/ipsec.secrets #Ip publica de la maquina servidor 1 90.0.0.2 : PSK \u0026#34;cXPeOAcKIVszFHp68CcGX6dLXcWcbrIl\u0026#34; debian@servidor2:~$ sudo cat /etc/ipsec.secrets #Ip publica de la maquina servidor 2 100.0.0.2 : PSK \u0026#34;cXPeOAcKIVszFHp68CcGX6dLXcWcbrIl\u0026#34; Once configured, we will restart the service at both ends:\ndebian@servidor1:~$ sudo ipsec restart debian@servidor2:~$ sudo ipsec restart Operating check We will now see that the tunnel has been lifted at both ends:\ndebian@servidor1:~$ sudo ipsec status Security Associations (1 up, 0 connecting): servidor1a2[1]: ESTABLISHED 62 seconds ago, 90.0.0.2[90.0.0.2]...100.0.0.2[100.0.0.2] servidor1a2{1}: INSTALLED, TUNNEL, reqid 1, ESP SPIs: ccb4e51d_i c186cf93_o servidor1a2{1}: 192.168.0.0/24 === 192.168.1.0/24 debian@servidor2:~$ sudo ipsec status Security Associations (1 up, 0 connecting): servidor2a1[2]: ESTABLISHED 45 seconds ago, 100.0.0.2[100.0.0.2]...90.0.0.2[90.0.0.2] servidor2a1{2}: INSTALLED, TUNNEL, reqid 1, ESP SPIs: c186cf93_i ccb4e51d_o servidor2a1{2}: 192.168.1.0/24 === 192.168.0.0/24 It is true that, unlike OpenVPN and WireGuard, StrongSwan does not automatically create a virtual interface for the VPN connection.

generation We can generate the certificates manually, but there is a tool called Easy RSA that automates this process. In addition, Easy RSA facilitates the generation of Diffie-Hellman modules, which are essential for the operation of the OpenVPN server.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t need to download it since it comes with the openvpn package.\nFor OpenVPN we need to create:\nA private key and a x509 certificate for the certifying authority it signs (CA) A private key and a signed x509 certificate for the server. A private key and a signed x509 certificate for each client. A Diffie-Hellman group for the server. On server 1, we will copy the variable example file to avoid the repeated request of information such as organization, country, province, etc., by EasyRSA.\ndebian@servidor1:/usr/share/easy-rsa$ sudo cp vars.example vars We will edit the same and change the following values:\ndebian@servidor1:/usr/share/easy-rsa$ sudo nano vars set_var EASYRSA_REQ_COUNTRY \u0026#34;ES\u0026#34; set_var EASYRSA_REQ_PROVINCE \u0026#34;Sevilla\u0026#34; set_var EASYRSA_REQ_CITY \u0026#34;Dos Hermanas\u0026#34; set_var EASYRSA_REQ_ORG \u0026#34;iesgn\u0026#34; set_var EASYRSA_REQ_EMAIL \u0026#34;contacto@javiercd.es\u0026#34; set_var EASYRSA_REQ_OU \u0026#34;Informatica\u0026#34; Once we have changed the default values to our own, we will start the public key infrastructure (PKI) using the EasyRSA script.

certificates manually, but there is a tool called Easy RSA that automates this process. In addition, Easy RSA facilitates the generation of Diffie-Hellman modules, which are essential for the operation of the OpenVPN server.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t need to download it since it comes with the openvpn package.\nFor OpenVPN we need to create:\nA private key and a x509 certificate for the certifying authority it signs (CA) A private key and a signed x509 certificate for the server. A private key and a signed x509 certificate for each client. A Diffie-Hellman group for the server. On server 1, we will copy the variable example file to avoid the repeated request of information such as organization, country, province, etc., by EasyRSA.\ndebian@servidor1:/usr/share/easy-rsa$ sudo cp vars.example vars We will edit the same and change the following values:\ndebian@servidor1:/usr/share/easy-rsa$ sudo nano vars set_var EASYRSA_REQ_COUNTRY \u0026#34;ES\u0026#34; set_var EASYRSA_REQ_PROVINCE \u0026#34;Sevilla\u0026#34; set_var EASYRSA_REQ_CITY \u0026#34;Dos Hermanas\u0026#34; set_var EASYRSA_REQ_ORG \u0026#34;iesgn\u0026#34; set_var EASYRSA_REQ_EMAIL \u0026#34;contacto@javiercd.es\u0026#34; set_var EASYRSA_REQ_OU \u0026#34;Informatica\u0026#34; Once we have changed the default values to our own, we will start the public key infrastructure (PKI) using the EasyRSA script.

As we have seen, this application that implements the Django tutorial has a test module.\nWe will build the Pipeline in several phases:\nExercise 1: Construction of a Docker image We start from the pipeline that we have developed in the Workshop 3: Continuous integration of Django application (Test), where we have automated the application test.\nModify the pipeline so that after doing the application test, it generates a Docker image. You have to keep in mind that the steps to generate the image must be performed on the machine where Jenkins is installed. You will have to add the following actions:\nBuild the image with the Dockerfile you have in the repository. Push the image to your Docker Hub account. Delete the created image. Therefore, you have to study the section Execution of a pipeline in multiple runners to run the pipeline in two runners:\nIn the Docker container from the image python:3, the steps from Workshop 3. In Jenkins\u0026rsquo; machine, the steps from this exercise. Other considerations:\nWhen the pipeline finishes running, you will receive a notification email. The pipeline will be saved in a Jenkinsfile file in your repository, and the pipeline configuration will refer to it. Delivery A screenshot where you see the output of a build that has been executed correctly.\nA screenshot of your Docker Hub account where you can see the latest pushed image.\nIntroduce a bug in the Dockerfile and show the output of the build where the error occurs.\nDeliver the repository URL to view the Jenkinsfile:\nhttps://github.com/javierasping/django_tutorial_docker.git Pants with the mail you received from the execution of the pipeline. Exercise 2: Deployment of the application Expand the previous pipeline to have a final stage where you can display the image that has been uploaded to Docker Hub in your production environment (VPS). Some leads:\nFind information on how to do the deployment to a remote server (ssh, looking for some plugin with that functionality,\u0026hellip;). If you are going to make ssh connections, you will have to save a credential on your Jenkins with the username and password. For deployment, you must use the docker-compose.yaml file you have generated in other practices. The container must be deleted with the previous version, the new image must be downloaded, and a new container created. Other considerations:\nChange the pipeline trigger. Configure it with a GitHub webhook so that every time a push is produced, the pipeline is run. For the webhook to access your Jenkins, you can use ngrok. Delivery The content of the Jenkinsfile file.

It allows the source code written by the programmers to be translated into computer-friendly instructions. One of the challenges associated with the compilation is the efficient management of the project files and units, which becomes even more crucial when working on large and complex projects.\nThis work aims to explore one of the most used mechanisms to compile projects in C: the use of a Makefile file. A Makefile is a configuration file that describes how to compile the source files of a project and how to manage the units between them. In addition, it allows to automate the compilation process and facilitates the task of maintaining and updating the code.\nThroughout this work, we will examine in detail the process of compiling a program in C using a Makefile. We will start by understanding the structure of a Makefile and how the compilation flow is defined. Then we will explore the advantages of its use, such as automatic detection of changes in the source files and selective collection. We will also address best practices to create effective and easy-to-maintain Makefilds.\nIn addition, we will analyze a practical example of a C program compilation, detailing the steps needed to create a Makefile and compile the project. We will also discuss the installation of the resulting program in a personal directory, avoiding interference with the package system.\nUltimately, we will learn how to clean up the program and understand the importance of proper software management in Unix / Linux systems.\nAs we progress in this work, we will gain a deeper understanding of the C-compilation and the usefulness of a Makefile as an essential tool in software development.\nCompilation of a C-program using a Makefile The first thing we\u0026rsquo;re going to install is fundamental for the compilation of C packages in Debian.\nThe building-essential package provides the necessary compilation tools, and dpkg-dev facilitates package management and source code delivery. You can install other specific development packages according to your needs, but these two are the most essential to start compiling C software in Debian.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s download the source files from the package that we want to compile in my case I will make it samba:\nOnce this is done we will see in our directory that a series of files and directories have been created:\nsamba-4.17.12 + dfsg: * * This is the directory that contains the Samba source code, which was downloaded from Debian repositories.

It is used as a basis for building the Debian package.

This script is used to configure samba compilation according to your needs and system characteristics:\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s compile the source code using the make command. This will be in charge of compiling the code and creating the executables and libraries that the script has created configure:\nThis will take a while depending on the size of the package in my case, it took me 8 minutes:\nOnce the code is compiled to install it we will use make install:\nOnce this is done we will have our package installed on the route / usr / local:\nNow to start the samba service we will run the nmbd file and make sure it is working:\nWe see that the installed version is the one we have compiled:\nUninstall the compiled package To remove the package we have compiled:\nWe see that it only leaves us the service configuration files:\nThey may remain in our samba trace system as the makefile file is not configured in this case to completely remove it, run whereis and remove the content of the routes:\nOnce this has been done, we will have removed the samba trail:\n","date":"November 29, 2023","hero":"/images/sistemas/compilacion_de_un_programa_en_c/compilacion_de_un_programa_en_c.jpg","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/sistemas/compilaciones_linux/compilacion_de_un_programa_en_c_utilizando_un_makefile/compilacion_de_un_programa_en_c_utilizando_un_makefile/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe compilation of programs in programming language C is a fundamental process in software development.

Explain in detail. The apt update command is the first fundamental step in the package update. It takes the following actions:\n-**Recovers Remote Metadata:**apt update communicates with online software repositories and recovers metadata related to available packages. These metadata include information on the latest versions of the packages, their dependencies and other essential information. -Update the Local Metadata Copy: Then apt reconstructs and updates the local copy of these metadata. This allows the system to quickly access information about the packages without having to download it repeatedly.\nOnce apt update has updated the information on the available packages, the next step is to use the apt upgrade command. This command makes a number of important steps:\n-Selection of Candidate Versions: apt selects the candidate versions of the available packages. These versions are often the most recent, although there are exceptions. -Unit Resolution: apt verifies and resolves the units between the packages to ensure that the update is carried out in a coherent manner and that all units are satisfied. -Packaging download: If you find new versions of packages, apt download these versions from the online repositories to the local cache of the system. -Packaging: apt unpack the recovered binary packages. -Execution of Orders Against: During the update, pre-installation command files are run, which may contain necessary settings and settings prior to installation. -Installation of binary files: The binary files of the new versions of the packages are installed in the system. -Execution of PostInst Orders: Finally, post-installation command files are run, which can perform additional settings after installation.\nExercise 2 List the list of packages that can be updated. What information can you draw according to what was shown in the list? You can check the list of packages that can be updated using the following apt list \u0026ndash;upgradable command. This command will show a list of packages available for the update and provide information on each of them. Here is a brief description of the information you can get from this list:\nPackage Name: The package name is the first column of the list. It shows you the name of the package that can be updated, for example, the name of the package. Current version: The currently installed version of the package is on the right of the package name, in the second column. For example, 1.2.3. Available version: The third column shows the latest available version of the package in the repositories. For example, 1.2.4. Update Status: In the last column, the status of the update is indicated. If there is an asterisk (\\ *) next to the package name, it means that that package is marked to be updated. Description of the Package: In addition to this basic information, the list also provides a brief description of the package, which gives you an overview of the function of the package and its purpose. Exercise 3 Indicates the installed version, candidate as well as the priority of the openssh-client package\nExercise 4 How can you get information out of an official package installed or not installed?**We can use the apt show command for packages installed as for non-installed. We can also do it with dpkg but the package has to be installed → dpkg -s:\nExercise 5 Take all the information you can from the openssh-client package you have currently installed on your machine Exercise 6 Take all the information you can from the openssh-client package candidate to update on your machine Exercise 7 lists all the content regarding the current openssh-client package of your machine. It uses both dpkg and apt for this. Using dpkg:\nUsing apt:\nExercise 8 List the contents of a package without the need to install or download it.\nWe can use apt file:\napt-file list [package] Exercise 9 Simulates the installation of the openssh-client package\nExercise 10 What command informs you of the possible bugs that a certain package presents? Exercise 11 After an apt update \u0026amp; \u0026amp; apt upgrade. If you wanted to update only the packages that have openssh chain. What procedure would you follow? Take this action, with the repetitive structures offered by bash, as well as with the xargs command. Using the repetitive structure of bash, using one line:\nUsing xargs:\nExercise 12 How would you find which packages depend on a specific package? With this we see the dependencies of the direct package:\nWhile with this the indirect dependencies:\nExercise 13 How would you proceed to find the package to which a particular file belongs? We can use dpkg:\nWe can use apt-file:\nExercise 14 What procedures would you use to release the cache in terms of parcel downloads? To clean the download cache:\nTo remove downloaded packages that are no longer in use:\nOr we can do both at once with apt clean:\nExercise 15 Realizes the installation of the keyboard-configuration package by previously passing the values of the configuration parameters as environment variables. We make sure we have the package installed:\nFor this we install debconfs-utils:\nIn a file we declare the variables we want to set on the keyboard:\nAnd we provide them to the debconf:\nAnd we will see that the changes have been implemented:\nExercise 16 Reconfigure the local package of your team, adding a location that does not exist previously. Check to modify the corresponding environment variables so that the user session uses another location. If we want to store our settings for each user we will export our variables and put them in the bashrc:\nThen we will run dpkg-reconfigure and observe that we will have selected the value of the variable:\nExercise 17 Interrupts the configuration of a package and explains the steps to be taken to continue the installation Once we break into the installation of a package, to continue the installation of the package we can use the dpkg command:\nWe can use the -a parameter for all packages or specify the name to continue your installation:\nExercise 18 Explains the instruction you would use to make a complete update of all the packages in your system in a completely non-interactive way Exercise 19 Blocks the update of certain packages We marked it to avoid updates and listed the marks to check that it was not updated:\nWork with .deb files Exercise 1 Download a package without installing it, i.e. download the corresponding .deb file. It indicates different ways of doing it. We can use the apt command:\nWe can use wget and download it from the repositories of should:\nExercise 2 How can you see the content, not extract it, from what will be installed in the system of a deb package? Exercise 3 On the .deb file downloaded, use the ar. ar command to extract the content of a deb package. It indicates the procedure for viewing the contents of the package. With the package you downloaded and using the ar command, decompress the package. What information do you have after the extraction? It indicates the purpose of the extracted. To view the content:\nTo decompress the directory:\nWe have extracted 3 files from the package:\ncontrol.tar.xz: Contains scripts that dpkg uses to install the package data.tar.xz: contains the package files debian-binary: indicates the version of the package It indicates the procedure to decompress the extracted by ar from the previous point. What information does it contain?\nTo decompress files we will use tar -xJf:\nWe will find the following directories and files:\n-**control * *: This file contains metadata on the package, such as its name, version, description, dependencies and other important details. -**confiles * *: This file lists the configuration files that are part of the package and that should be treated in a special way during updates to preserve the user\u0026rsquo;s custom settings. -**pre * *: This is a pre-installation script that runs before the package is installed in the system. It may contain necessary preconfiguration actions. -**postinst * *: This is a post-installation script that runs after the package has been installed on the system. It may contain necessary post-configuration actions. -**prerm * *: This is a pre-emotion script that runs before the package is disinstalled from the system. It may contain necessary pre-elimination actions. -**dzm * *: This is a postremoval script that runs after the package has been disinstalled from the system. It may contain necessary post-elimination actions. -**md5sums * *: This file contains the MD5 control sums of the files that are installed with the package. It is used to verify file integrity during installation.\nThe data.tar.xz file contains the files and directories that will be installed in the system when the package is installed.\nWork with repositories Exercise 1 Add to your source file. Exercise 2 Configure the APT system so that the debian bullseye packages are given the highest priority and therefore the ones that are installed by default. Exercise 3 Configure the APT system so that the bullseye-backports packages have a higher priority than those of unstable. Exercise 4 How do you add the possibility of downloading i386 architecture parcel into your system. What command did you use? List of non-native architectures. How would you proceed to discard the possibility of downloading parcel from i386 architecture? To add:\nTo eliminate it:\nExercise 5 If you wanted to download a package, how can you know all available versions of that package? Exercise 6 Indicates the procedure for downloading a package from the stable repository.\nAs we have it configured the packages per priority will be downloaded from the stable repository. But we can tell him:\nExercise 7 Indicates the procedure to download a package from the buster-backports repository You have to have the repository indicated in the sources.list then you can indicate it with the -t parameter.\nExercise 8 Indicates the procedure to download a package from the Sid repository Just like the previous exercise we only indicated here Sid as we have indicated the repository in the sources.list:\nExercise 9 Indicates the procedure to download an i386 architecture package.**We indicate the name of the package followed by: i386\nWork with directories What do they do?\n/ var / lib / apt / lists /:**This directory contains lists of packages available in the configured repositories in my system. These lists are .list extension files that contain information about the available packages, their versions and the sources from which they can be downloaded. When I run apt update, I update these lists. / var / lib / dpkg / available:**This file contains information about the installed packages and their versions. It is used by my dpkg package management system to keep a record of the packages I have installed and their states. It provides information on available packages and their dependencies. / var / lib / dpkg / status:**This file also contains information about the packages installed in my system, but provides a more detailed view than / var / lib / dpkg / available. It contains information on the status of the packages, as if they are installed, uninstalled or if there are problems with their configuration. / var / cache / apt / files /:**This directory stores the package files that I download before they are installed in my system. When I run commands like apt-get install or apt-get upgrade, the packages are downloaded first in this directory and then installed. Keeping a copy of the packages downloaded in this directory can be useful if you want to reinstall or uninstall a package without redownloading it from the repositories, which helps save time and bandwidth.

User with superuser permissions: You must have access to a user with sudo privileges on the server in order to perform the installation and configuration tasks. Full Domain Name (FQDN): If you want to access your WordPress site through a custom domain, make sure you have a full domain name (FQDN) set up and pointed to the server. Internet access: You need Internet access to download packages and make updates during the installation process. Make sure you meet all these requirements before you start installing WordPress on your server.\nIf you do not have the LEMP battery, you can follow it in this link.\nCreating a VirtualHost in Nginx The creation of a VirtualHost in Nginx allows you to configure multiple websites on a single server. Follow these steps to create a VirtualHost in Nginx.\nCopy the default Nginx configuration file to use as an example and name it as you like.

We will also address the configuration of an Apache server using IPv6 capabilities.\nLinux IPV6 Self-Configuration Connect two Linux machines to the same switch and check that they have IPv6 connectivity using the local link address.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll check the IPV6 that the different pcs have. PC1 has - \u0026gt; fe80::ef7:42ff:fe92:0/64\nWhile PC2 has - \u0026gt; fe80:: e5f: 61ff: feee: 0 / 64\nThese two addresses are called local link and are automatically assigned to each network interface. This type will only allow us to communicate with the devices of our local network and have the prefix - \u0026gt; FE80:: / 10\nIf we do a ping from one of these to another with the local link address we can communicate:\nSLAAC Add a third Linux machine to the same network and connect it as a router so that it gives global IPv6 addresses to the other two using SLAAC. Do not forget to install RADVD. Check that they have connectivity.\nThe first thing we will do is set the network interface per ipv6 of our router in this case I will assign you the prefix 3333: db7::\nWe calculate the fixed part of our address:\nR1 - \u0026gt; 0c: 01: 30: a0: 00: 00 - \u0026gt; 0c: 01: 30: ff: faith: a0: 00: 00 - \u0026gt; 0E: 01: 30: FF: FE: A0: 00: 00\nWe edit the interfaces and apply the configuration of our network card:\nWe restarted the service and would have a global address:\nSLAAC (Stateless Address Self-reliability) is a unique configuration mechanism for IPV6. There is no equivalent in IPV4. Which allows the nodes in our network to be automatically configured.\nFrom the local link address that all hosts have, by means of the neghbour discovery protocol requests if there is any router within the local network will provide you with the network configuration parameters\nThe first thing we will do to configure SLAAC will be to install the radvd package:\nIf we look at the state of the demon this will tell us that you do not find your configuration file:\nSo we will generate you one by indicating the interface that is going to distribute directions and we will also tell you the behavior that you will have on our network:\n-**MinRtrAdvInterval:**Indicates the minimum time in seconds by which the router will send a message in seconds. -**MaxRtrAdvInterval:**Indicates the maximum time in second by which the router will send a message.\n-**AdvSendAdvert:**Indicates whether or not the interface sent warnings. -**AdvManagedFlag:**Indicates whether we want the service to use DHCPv6 (on) or not (off). -**Prefix:**Indicates the network prefix using SLAAC to assign addresses. -**AdvValidLifetime:**Indicates time in seconds that an IPV6 address will be valid. -**AdvPreferenredLifetime:**Indicates time in seconds that an address generated from the prefix will be preferred instead of other directions.\nOnce done we restart the service and the demon will start setting up our customers:\nWe will also have to set the forwarding bit for ipv6 in our router, as with ipv4 we edit the / etc / sysctl.conf file:\nSLAAC messages\nWe can see how the PC1 has been configured using SLAAC:\nThe PC2 has also been configured:\nWe will study the messages that have intervened in this SLAAC configuration, if we number them as in this Wireshark capture:\n-Router application(RS) (It does not appear in the capture): The PC sends an RS message to all routers to indicate that it needs an RA, this message is sent if it does not receive any RA after a while. -Router Advertising(RA): Once the router receives the RS or periodically sends an RA in which the network prefix and its length are included. The RA message is sent to the IPv6 address of all nodes, FF02:: 1, with the link-local address of the router as the IPv6 address of origin. (N0 6 and 12). -Multicast Listar Report Message v2: Indicates that the x device has started a listening session for multicast traffic (No 7 and 9). -Needbor Application(NS): It is used to know the MAC address of a device in your network, it is similar to the ARP protocol. (No 10,11,613). -Neighbbor Advertising(NA): It is the response message of an NS (No 614).\nOnce the client has received an RA, it then sets its IPV6 address, with a 64-bit network prefix but needs an IID (Interface Identifier).\nThere are two ways that customers can create their own unique IID:\n-**EUI-64:**via the EUI-64 process, PC1 creates an IID using its 48-bit MAC address. -**Random generation:**The 64-bit IID can be a random number generated by the client operating system.\nSince SLAAC is a state-of-the-art process, for customers to use this recently created IPv6 address, you must verify that it is unique. The customer will send an NS with its own address as the target IPv6 address. If no other device responds with a neighbor\u0026rsquo;s ad message, the address is unique and can be used by the customer. If it receives an NA, the address is not unique, and the operating system must determine a new interface ID to use.\nThis process is part of the detection of ICMPv6 neighbors and is known as \u0026ldquo;detection of duplicate addresses (DAS).\u0026rdquo;\nThis image explains the configuration of an interface by SLAAC. Now let\u0026rsquo;s check that different customers have connectivity between themselves:\nPC1 - \u0026gt; 3333:db7::ef7:42ff:fe92:0 PC2 - \u0026gt; 3333:db7::e5f:61ff:feee:0 R1 - \u0026gt; 3333:db7::e01:30ff:fea0:0\nRouter 1:\nPC2:\nWe have to keep in mind that these address \u0026ldquo;concessions\u0026rdquo; are not stored anywhere, i.e. on the server we do not store the settings that the service has performed.\nDHCPv6 with SLAAC Change the settings to use DHCPv6 instead of SLAAC by also sending DNS servers. Check that the machines have connectivity.\nFor this we install the DHCPv6 server, the package is the same for ipv4:\nWe edit the configuration file for IPV6 - \u0026gt; sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd6.conf:\nIn the /etc/default/isch-dhcp-server file we will indicate not only the interface we want to distribute addresses if we will not also specify that the server will work for IPV6:\nWe restart the service and check that it is working with the parameters we have assigned to you in the set up:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check that customers were configured using ipv6, for which the configuration on the network interfaces is quite similar to IPV4:\nWe restart the networking.service and get the DHCP configuration on the card:\nWe can also see the concessions file on the server on the following route /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd6.leases:\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned it before, but in order for the configuration to occur, the client will obtain the parameters we have configured by DHCPv6, we will have to put this parameter to ON in the SLAAC configuration file:\nAs we can see the only parameter we have specified on the DHCP server to be the google DNS has been correctly configured on our client:\nDHCPv6 messages with SLAAC We just set up SLAAC and DHCPv6 without status, this means that:\nUse SLAAC to get a unique global IPV6 address, in addition to the link door. Use the status-free DHCPv6 server for the rest of our network configuration parameters. That is, we have set the second option in the following image:\n{\u0026lt; alert type = \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;} The catches you will see below are NOT cut because they look pixelated. The communication messages are in order. {\u0026lt; / alert \u0026gt;}\nIf we look at the capture of Wireshark and compare it to the unique configuration of SLAAC:\nSLAAC operations:\nWe can see that the PC1 has requested an RS, to all the routers on the network (Multicast) R1 responds to PC1 with an RA (Indicates if you need to communicate with a DHCPv6 with or without a state) NS, to check that the assigned address is not duplicated DHCPv6 operations:\nRequest all DHCPv6 servers on the network (Multicast at ff02:: 1: 2) includes a CID client identifier. Warning: It is the DHCPv6 server response to a request, this includes the appropriate configuration options, including an IPv6. It also includes a CID and an XID (Id transaction). Request: The customer sends this message to all DHCPv6 servers to indicate that he wants the parameters offered in the Adverstide. They also include CID and XID. Reply: The DHCPv6 server responds and confirms that the address has been assigned as well as all additional configuration parameters. They also include CID and XID. Here I leave you an image in which we observe the order of the messages we have received and a brief description of it, and it also tells us if the messages are unicast or multicast:\nApache on IPV6 For Apache versions above 2.X have support for IPV6 enabled by default so when installing the service we will already be listening for this protocol without any additional configuration in the service.\nWe can check if by installing it our server is listening through that port:\nIn the event that we create a virtualhost we can specify how we want you to work whether using both IPV6 and IPV4 protocols or just one of them. We see that ssh also uses ipv6 by default.\nAccess to the web server from within the network We will access from the machines of our network in my case I have mounted it on the router as it is the only one who has Internet access in this scenario.\nI will connect to the one using the global address but we could use the local without problem as we belong to the same local network.\nAccess from PC2:\nAccess to the web server from outside the network For this we must configure R1 and \u0026lsquo;PC3\u0026rsquo; on the same network using IPV6:\nPC3:\nR1:\nWe will ask PC1 from PC3 to be outside that local network, as we see no need to do NAT.\nI can even ping a host from another network:\nSi analizamos estas peticiones con Wireshark podemos ver que en ningún momento se produce\nNAT:\nOutside the network:\nWithin the network:\nOf course a host of our local network can access the web server:\nCISCO Setting up a swan router in IPV6 The first thing we will do is calculate the IPV6 address that corresponds to the MACS:\nF 0/0 –\u0026gt; CA:01:6C:FA:00:00 –\u0026gt; CA:01:6C:FF:FE:FA:00:00 –\u0026gt; C801:6CFF:FEFA:0\nF 1/0 –\u0026gt; CA:01:6C:FA:00:1C-→ CA:01:6C:FF:FE:FA:00:1C –\u0026gt; C801:6CFF:FEFA:001C\nSo that our router is configured using SLACC and we do not have to do this manually we will enter the following commands for each of the interfaces that we want to be configured by SLAAC:\nWe will also have to indicate no shut for the interface to be lifted.\nWith the following command we will check that our router has been set up automatically using SLAAC:\nWith the local link addresses we will have connectivity with the router:\nSLAAC Now let\u0026rsquo;s get the router to configure the customers using SLAAC.\nWe will set a global address to our router in the interface that gives the network that we want to give this service, with the network prefix: 3333: db7:\nWe will use EUI-64 to configure our interfaces:\nFastEthernet 0/0 –\u0026gt; 3333::C801:6CFF:FEFA:0/64\nFastEthernet 1/0 –\u0026gt; 2222::C801:6CFF:FEFA:1C/64\nWe checked the IPV6 addresses have been \u0026ldquo;generated\u0026rdquo; correctly:\nFor the router to configure us to customers we will need to enter the following command this, will cause our router to command RA and respond to RS requests:\nOnce this has been done our customers will have been set up correctly:\nPC1:\nPC2:\nThe messages that have been produced when setting up the customers:\nRouter application(RS): The PC sends an RS message to all routers to indicate that it needs an RA, this message is sent if it does not receive any RA after a while.\nRouter Advertising(RA): Once the router receives the RS or regularly sends an RA in which the network prefix and its length are included. In case the router responds to a RS, it sends a specific RA to the host who requested it. In case it is a periodic RA message it is sent to the IPv6 address of multidissemination of all nodes, FF02:: 1, with the link-local address of the router as the original IPv6 address.\nNeedbor Application(NS): It is used to know the MAC direction of a device in your network, it is similar to the ARP protocol.\nNeighbbor Advertising(NA): It is the response message of an NS.\nDHCPv6 with SLAAC Configure a status DHCPv6 server is similar to setting a status-free server. The most important difference is that a state server also includes IPv6 address information similar to a DHCPv4 server.\nThe first thing we\u0026rsquo;ll have to do will be to enable the IPv6 routing. This command is not necessary for the router to be a state-of-the-art DHCPv6 server, but is required for the router to originate the ICMPv6 RA messages.\nipv6 unicast-routing\nWe have it set in the previous section so we won\u0026rsquo;t do it again. We will set up a DHCPV6 pool:\nWith DHCPv6 with status, all steering parameters and other configuration parameters must be assigned by the DHCPv6 server. The address prefix command is used to indicate the set of addresses to be assigned by the server. The lifetime option indicates the valid and preferred lease time in seconds. As with non-state DHCPv6, the client uses the original IPv6 address of the package containing the RA message.\nWe indicate the network prefix and the life time of each address:\nWe now indicate DNS servers:\nWe can still set up more parameters like the domain name but in my case I\u0026rsquo;m only interested in this, so we\u0026rsquo;ll proceed to tell you where the interface has to work the service:\nWe will now check that the DHCP server, is working on our interface:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll see how the DNS service has been assigned to the customer:\nAnd the concession on the DHCP server:\nSLAAC operations:\nWe can see that the PC2 has requested an RS, to all the routers on the network (Multicast) R1 responds to PC1 with an RA (Indicates if you need to communicate with a DHCPv6 with or without a state) DHCPv6 operations:\nRequest all DHCPv6 servers on the network (Multicast at ff02:: 1: 2) includes a CID client identifier. Warning: It is the DHCPv6 server response to a request, this includes the appropriate configuration options, including an IPv6. It also includes a CID and an XID (Id transaction). Request: The customer sends this message to all DHCPv6 servers to indicate that he wants the parameters offered in the Adverstide. They also include CID and XID.

Active Directory is an integral Microsoft solution for identity management and access control in business networks. Through this guide, we will learn step by step how to implement a Ubuntu server as a domain controller, establish Kerberos-based authentication and configure directory services by using Samba.\nIntroduction You want to set up a Linux server (Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS) to service a set of client equipment (Windows and Linux).\nI will take advantage that the stage is mounted from previous class activities and I will restore the snapshots to have the clean machines.\nPreparation of the environment 1. The Linux server will not have a graphic environment. You will have at least the partitions: root, home and exchange. Here we can see that I have no graphic environment installed, we can see that the service is active, however, no environment is launched. Also, if we look for any process with the best known desktop names, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t give us any results.\nHere I show you the partitions that my Ubuntu server has (root, boot, home and swap):\n#2. The server must be prepared for remote administration (from now on all management will be done remotely from another network equipment).\nTo manage it remotely I will use ssh, for this we install it on the server:\nOnce it is installed we will have it running, no configuration is necessary.\nIf we check the service status we can see that you have taken the default configuration:\nTo connect remotely we will need to know the IP of the equipment or the name:\nIn my case I will connect from the external network to our server (enp0s3), we have previously configured the network with netplan:\nAnd we have implemented the changes:\nOnce we know this data we will connect by ssh from a machine in our network to follow with the other sections, in my case I will use my host machine, for this I have installed the openssh-client package previously:\n#3. Create the following users and groups\nGroups: teachers, students, smr, asir. I believe the groups: User to create: profedesiree, profejose, proferaul, erik, manu, olive, sandra, fabio and domi I believe the users:\nI created them with home directory and assigned them the 1234 password:\nTeachers: profedesiree, profejose and proferaul. We add them: We can check that they have been added with the following command:\nStudents: erik, manu, olive, sandra, fabio and domi. We add them:\nWe check that they have been added:\nUsers of the group smr: profedesiree, profejose, proferaul, erik, manu and olive. We add them:\nWe check that they have been added:\nUsers of the asir group: sandra, fabio and domi. We check that they have been added:\n4. All users will be Samba users. For this we must have installed samba: To add a samba user we must enter the following command and assign a password:\nWe will do this with the 9 users, once added we can use this command to list the samba users we have:\nSamba domain controller 5. Create and configure a Samba domain controller on the Server. Before starting the installation we must take into account a number of data:\nActive Directory * domain controller name: FJCD Name of the domain of * Active Directory *: javiercrucies.local Name of the Kerberos Kingdom: javiercrucies.local NetBIOS name of the domain: javiercrosses Fixed IP address of the server: 192.168.0.1 Server role: Domain Controller (DC) DNS Reporter: 192.168.0.1 Once with these clear data we will start with the installation, the first thing is to update the system:\nNext we will need to change the name of our server to be in line with the data we have selected before, for this I have selected my initials, for this we edit the file * / etc / hostname *:\nNow we need to reboot the equipment to apply the changes, we will lose the connection by ssh:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the ssh remote control back in a few minutes when you have restarted:\nAs you can see we have connected using the old name that our server had, this is because the / etc / hosts file, contains an IP address ratio with its corresponding logical names. This file contained a reference to the old name of the server itself, which we will change to refer to the new name:\nOnce we have applied these two changes, before we continue we would only have to make sure that our server has the network properly configured. In our stage we have two network cards on our server:\nenp0s3 (External card, gives us internet access) enp0s8 (Internal card, is the one that communicates with our local network) Because of this the first is configured by DHCP, as we do not care about the configuration that is assigned to it, however, the second is configured statically, as we must control the configuration of it so that we have control over it and then join the equipment to the domain.\nOnce this is clarified, at the beginning of the document I indicate how the interfaces are configured, here I leave a screen to remember the addresses:\nWe will now need to have some packages that must be installed before starting, these are:\nsamba: file server, printing and authentication for SMB / CIFS. smbclient: command line customers for SMB / CIFS. krb5-config: Configuration files for Kerberos Version 5. winbind: Service to solve information about users and groups of Windows NT servers. We can install these four packages with a simple command:\nKerberos, will ask us about the kingdom (domain name) during the installation of the packages, in our case it will be javiercrucies.local:\nHere we will enter the name of our server team:\nHere we will re-enter the name of our server:\nAfter this, the installation will continue a little further, but without need for more information:\nWe will now configure samba, but before we do so we will change the name to the * smb.conf * configuration file so that you do not use it while we configure it and so we will also have a copy of the original file:\nWe will use the samba-tool domain provision command, so that it is the command itself that requests the values you need and, where possible, suggests its default values. So, if these match those we expect, it will be very likely that the previous steps have been the right ones:\nAs you can see, it is very intuitive to do so, since except for the forwarder IP and the administrator password we have chosen the answers that the same command offers us. This must meet minimum complexity requirements:\nat least 8 characters 1 capital 1 number or symbol This, in addition to setting up Samba, has generated a configuration file for Kerberos on the route / var / lib / samba / private / krb5.conf. So we\u0026rsquo;ll copy it to / etc:\nThe following will be to configure the resolution of names, for this we will start by stopping the services involved:\nWe will also remove them from starting automatically when restart the equipment:\nWe will then make sure that the samba- and ad- dc service can be started without difficulty, avoiding any masking that may exist:\nThen we delete the resolv.conf file which, in fact, will be a link to stub-resolv.conf. So we eliminate it and create a new one to remove it:\nWe now introduce the right values according to our domain, for my case:\nWe save the changes and get out of the file.\nWe will start the samba-ad@-@ dc service and enable it to start when restart the equipment:\nCheck the installation If we have managed to get here, we have all the ballots so that our installation has been correct. But it\u0026rsquo;s never too much to do a few checks.\nConsult the domain level and create a new user To know our domain level we simply enter this command:\nIn doing so, we check that the level of the domain, and of the forest where it is located, is equivalent to a Windows Server 2008 R2 installation\nWe will try to create a new user account in the domain with the command (we will need to take into account password policy):\nConfirm that the DNS server works properly The first thing is to check the LDAP service on the TCP protocol, for which we will write the following order:\nIf we have an answer similar to that, it all works as it should.\nWe will then check the SRV record for the Kerberos protocol on UDP, for which we use the following order:\nThe answer must be similar to the previous one, if so SRV record is correct.\nFinally, we check the resolution of the name of our server:\nCheck the operation of Kerberos To check the operation we can, for example, use the smbclient command to check the services that a particular user can get. For this we will use the following command:\nIf authentication is correct, we\u0026rsquo;ll know Kerberos is doing his job. If we want, we can even log into the server using the administrator account. To achieve this, we will use a syntax like this:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve already checked everything so we can start joining customers to our domain.\nJoin the domain #6. It integrates at least one Windows client into the Samba domain.\nWindows client\nThe first thing we will do is set up our client\u0026rsquo;s network:\nIP: 192.168.0.10 Subnet mass: / 24 Liaison door 192.168.0.1 DNS 192.168.0.1 Both cards (Internal server and Windows client) must be in internal network for communication.\nOnce the card is configured, we will do a ping to the server to check the connectivity:\nNow we access control panel → system and security → system → advanced system configuration → team name → network id. We select the first option to join the domain\nWe will select the first option, as our network has a domain:\nWe will now need to enter the data of the administrator user and the name of our domain:\nThe administrator user that is created by default in samba is called the administrator\nOnce you enter the data you will ask us if we want to create a domain account on this computer, I will select that no:\nAnd for the changes to be applied, we must restart:\nOnce restart we can log in with the different users of our domain:\nWe can see that we can log into the team with the accounts of our domain:\nLinux client\nThe first thing is to set up the network, for which I have assigned the IP address 192.168.0.2\nWe will now have to add to our server in the host file, a line in which the IP address of our server will go followed by the name of this server and the full domain name of our server:\nTo check this change we have made we will do a ping to the server using its name:\nWe will now update the equipment to download the latest versions from the repositories:\nTo have the Internet on the client I have previously configured NAT on the server.\nOnce the system is updated we will install the following packages:\nsssd (System Security Services Daemon): Manages authentication mechanisms and access to remote directories. It replaces the classic Winbind with more speed and stability. heimdal-clients: This is a free implementation of Kerberos 5 created with the intention of being compatible with the Kerberos protocol implemented by the MIT. msktutil: The utility of Kerberos\u0026rsquo; keytabs in a Microsoft Active Directory environment. We can do it with 1 command:\nAs we install you will request the name of our active directory server so we enter it:\nNow you will ask us the name of the computer that acts as a server in our case is:\nFinally, he will ask us about the administrative server that in our case is the same:\nOnce this is done, the installation will continue without having to enter more data.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add additional data to Kerberos to make sure it behaves properly. We will start by changing the name of the configuration file, so that we can return to the original parameters if necessary:\nWe will now use nano to edit the file settings, it will be empty so we will add the following:\nOnce filled in with our domain data, we save the files and check if we can log into the domain:\nIf the output does not offer us any error, it is because the authentication process has worked properly.\nWe will proceed to join the domain, for this we will use the following command:\nThis command will have to be completed according to the data of our domain, in case we do not get any output, we will have joined the domain.\nTo complete the task, we will remove the kerberos authorization tickets that we activate when running kinit. To achieve this, just use the kdestroy command.\nShare folders #7. Personal folders are needed on the server for each user. There will also be a folder for each group, to which only the members of each group can access and write.\nWe will create the directories in the root partition for each user and one for each group. These will be created by the name of the group or user:\nWe have to bear in mind that the samba users we have generated at the beginning of the document have been removed when installing the domain and we will have to produce them again.\nWe will share these folders through samba, for this we edit the / etc / samba / smb.conf file:\nTo indicate that you can access a group we will have to put an @ in front of the group name:\nWe would only be able to correctly assign the appropriate local permissions for our resources and change the folder owners so that users can write on them:\nThis would be the right thing to do, but if we assign you the 775 permissions we can\u0026rsquo;t write in the folder, so we\u0026rsquo;ll assign you all the permissions:\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ll repeat this with all the directories, first I\u0026rsquo;ll give you the permissions:\nAnd finally we will change the folder owners and make each user or group their respective owners:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s make sure we have applied these changes correctly:\nWe will check that we can access the shared resources from the olive user, we will access the Oliver folder and create a directory within:\n8. From Windows access these folders through network drives. From the file browser we can see all the shared resources on the network. Now we will create network units, so for example we will add the Oliver folder to the Oliver user as a network drive, for this, we right click on the folder \u0026gt; connect to network drive:\nAnd we will select a letter to assign to the network unit:\nNow this unit will appear on this team:\nMobile profiles 9. Define mobile profiles on the Linux server using Samba, so that users can authenticate on different Windows machines, maintaining their configuration. To do this we will install RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools) that will allow us to manage our samba domain controller identical to windows server. To add them we will search the search for Windows * * * Add optional features * * once here we will give you to add feature:\nOnce here we will look for the following features with RSAT and install them:\nOnce installed we will be created an application similar to that of a Windows server called administrative tools:\nWe will be opened a folder with the management tools:\nAnd we will search for user management and active directory equipment or write in running dsa.msc, this we will do with the user managing our domain to be able to access this:\nBefore creating our mobile user we will create a network resource as we have previously done called profiles and we will give the mobile group permission to write on them:\nFor our user to write in this directory we will add it to the group:\nNow we go to the configuration of our user and we change the profile path. We will put the path of our shared folder profiles followed by * *% username% * *:\nWe kept and we would have made our mobile profile created.\nWe will demonstrate the operation of the mobile profile, for which I have changed the background and created two folders:\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s log in and start it on the Windows on the right:\nWe see that the mobile profile has been properly performed.\nNFS 10. Through NFS, folders: projects, documentation, programs _ and _ drivers will be shared on the server. The first can only be read; the last two can also be written. Linux equipment will automatically mount the folders in the boot. The first thing we will do is install the following packages:\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ll create in the root the directories we\u0026rsquo;re going to share:\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;ll change the owner and the permissions to these directories:\nAfter this, we must edit the / etc / exports file. This is the file where the folders we are going to share are indicated to NFS. The first one will be read only and the last two can be written:\nTo access these resources on the server we will install the following packages:\nNow we will create the directories where we will mount our folders:\nTo manually mount them in Linux we will do the following command:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check that in projects we can\u0026rsquo;t write:\nWhile in the other two we can write:\nIf we want to access these resources in Windows \u0026ndash; \u0026gt;\\ 192.168.0.1\\ documentation\n\\ 192.168.0.1\\ projects (reading only directory)\n\\ 192.168.0.1\\ programs\\ _ and\\ _ drivers\nTo view them you need to have the following features installed in Windows (We can access this program through the Windows search engine by writing Windows features)\nTo end with this point we will set that Linux equipment automatically mount when you start the directories. We will edit the / etc / fstab file by adding the following lines:\nOnce this is done we will reboot and we will see that we will have been automatically mounted:\nQuotas\n#11. The server / home folder will have a quota system to avoid saturation with user files (100 MB per user).\nThe first thing we will do is install the packages to implement quotas:\nWe will now allow the shares in the partition / home by adding this to the fstab of our server:\nWe take the home partition to apply these changes:\nAnd we apply quotas on the partition / home\nWe will check that at the root of the partition we have been created two files (afuca.group and afuca.user):\nWe will now apply the 100Mb quota to olive using edcupa:\nWe will now use a tool which is * gawk, * which will allow us to focus on this command, apply the quota we have just created for Oliver to all our users:\nThe order we just launched has drawn a list of all users and has applied Oliver\u0026rsquo;s quota to all users with an ID greater than 499.\nWe will now review the quotas to see how they are:\nTo check that it works we will exhaust the proferaul user\u0026rsquo;s share, for this we will create a 30 MB file:\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ll move him to the home directory of him and make him the owner of the file:\nWe see that the space used in the user directory is updated:\nWebmin #12. Install Webmin on the server to have the possibility to manage it graphically from a client. Show some of your functionalities.\nWebmin is a modern web control panel that allows you to manage your Linux server through a browser-based interface.\nWe will need to install apache to be able to install webmin on our server:\nWe will now have to add the webmin repository, so we will edit the sources.list and add it:\nWe save the file and make an apt update to update the repositories, we will be wrong warning us that the repository is not reliable.\nSo now we will download the PGP key from Webmin and add it to our system:\nWe go back to making an apt update and see that now the repository is reliable\nBelow we will download the webmin package:\nThe latest lines of the installation will give us the data to access this service web:\nSo in a client we go to the browser and access this url:\nIt will tell us that the connection is not private, to skip this warning Advanced configuration \u0026gt; access\nWe will have a portal where we will need to enter with an administrator user of our server:\nThe first thing we will see on the web interface will be a resource monitor, as well as data from our team:\nWe will see a resource monitor history, which will show us the hours and percentage of use of our hardware, as well as system information:\nWe have more sections such as recent login or network interfaces, which will give us information about who has connected and their settings respectively:\nTo end with the panel we will have a last window which will tell us the use of the disk and partitions:\nOnce we have taken a look at the main page we are going to take advantage of a functionality that has to allow us to view the directories shared by nfs, to access here we are going to networking \u0026gt; NFS exports:\nCome on, it also allows us to edit the current shared directories as well as add or delete these.\nIn addition, this tool allows us to set up a Firewall with iptables, which is now of vital importance to have security on our network:\nIt even has a web terminal so that we can manage the server from a client, to access it we deploy the menu and click on the terminal symbol or we press Alt + K:\nWe see you using ssh with the user connected in the application, in my case javiercrosses:\nWebmin includes many more management functions that help us work with the server in a graphic way to make it more friendly to manage it, from updating packages to setting up a Firewall. In addition, it uses https, so our traffic would travel encrypted, which would allow us to configure nat to be able to access from a device that is outside our network, without a snifer being able to decipher our traffic easily. It is advisable that we change the self-signed certificate that uses webmin to one of our own that we can generate with Let\u0026rsquo;s encrypt, for example.\nCUPS #13. There will be a CUPS printing server, which will be administered from a Ubuntu client. The first thing we need to do is install on the cup server:\nOnce this is done we will configure the service to allow to be managed from our Ubuntu client, for this we edit the following file:\nWe will now add the following parameters:\nListen 192.168.0.1: 631 allow 192.168.0.0 / 24 To allow our client Ubuntu to be able to manage the service\nNow we\u0026rsquo;d only have to restart the service:\nWe will move to the client and in the browser we will enter the ip of our server followed by two points and 631:\nWith this we have checked that the client can manage coups.\n#14. Set up a network printer for all users, with daily page limits for all users.\nTo share our network printer, we access the web panel and in the management section we mark sharing printers connected to this system:\nBefore setting the limits we will enable the service to register the name of the users when sending files, for that in the cups.conf file we change this default value to none:\nWe will now restart the service:\nTo set a daily limit for each 20-page user for example, we would apply the following command for our printer.\nOnce this command has been applied, users will only be able to print the indicated number of pages, when they exceed the limit the works will be sent to cups, but it will remove them from the tail and will not print them:\nIn other words, work 21 in this example will not be created until 24 hours.\nBibliography [How to know what desktop I have] (https: / / www.sysadmit.com / 2020 / 06 / linux-as-know-that-scriptorio@-@ tengo.html) [Mounting samba domain controller] (http: / / somebooks.es / create -a-controller-de-domino-de-active-directory-con-samba-en-ubuntu-18-04-lts /) [Configure the network with netplan] (http: / / somebooks.es / establish -a -direction-ip-estatica-ubuntu-server-17-10-posterios /) [Unite client linux to domain part 1] (http: / / somebooks.es / unir-a-cliente-ubuntu-20-04-a-a-domine-of-active-directory-over-windows-server-2019-part-1 /) [Unite client linux to domain part 2] (http: / / somebooks.es / unir-a-cliente-ubuntu-20-04-a-a-domine-of-active-directory-over-windows-server-2019-part-2 /) [Manage domain with RSAT] (http: / / somebooks.es / 12-7-administrar-el-control-de-domino-resara-con-rsat /) [Access shared folders w10] (http: / / somebooks.es / nfs-parte-6-acceder-a-la-carpeta-comparta-de-a-cliente-windows-10 /) [Contributions] (https: / / www.linuxtotal.com.mx / index.php? cont = info _ admon _ 018) [Installation and use of webmin] (https: / / www.digitalocean.com / community / tutorials / how-to-install-webmin-on-ubuntu-20-04-es) [CUPS Commands] (https: / / docs.oracle.com / cd / E26921 _ 01 / html / E25809 / gllgm.html) ","date":"September 20, 2023","hero":"/images/sistemas/ad_ubuntu/portada.jpeg","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/sistemas/ad_ubuntu/ad_ubuntu/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this post, we will explore how to set up an Active Directory environment on an Ubuntu server using tools such as Kerberos and Samba.

To carry out the installation on our stage machines, we will use the apt package manager in Odin, which runs Debian 12. We will also install the same package in Thor and Loki, which are containers housed within Odin. As for Hela, a Rocky operating system, it will require the use of dnf for installation.\njaviercruces@odin:~$ sudo apt install systemd-journal-remote -y javiercruces@thor:~$ sudo apt install systemd-journal-remote -y javiercruces@loki:~$ sudo apt install systemd-journal-remote -y [javiercruces@hela ~]$ sudo dnf install systemd-journal-remote -y On the server, enable and activate the two systems components needed to receive log messages with the following command:\njaviercruces@odin:~$ sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-journal-remote.socket javiercruces@odin:~$ sudo systemctl enable systemd-journal-remote.service In the client, enable the component that you use to send the registration messages to the server:\n[javiercruces@hela ~]$ sudo systemctl enable systemd-journal-upload.service Then on the server, open ports 19532 and 80 on the firewall. This will allow the server to receive the customer\u0026rsquo;s registration messages. The port 80 is the port that certbot will use to generate the TLS certificate. In our case there\u0026rsquo;s no firewall so it won\u0026rsquo;t be necessary.\nStep 2: Generation of keys and certificates\nSince we will use the encrypted service to ensure that no one can access our records, I will proceed to generate the certificates using OpenSSL.\nWe can generate the certificates manually, but there is a tool called Easy RSA that automates this process.

Its main function is to find the MAC address associated with a specific IP address on a local network. When one device needs to communicate with another on the same network, it uses ARP to determine the MAC address of the destination before sending data.\nDo you think the ARP question is a message of dissemination? Make a Wireshark capture of an ARP request and analyze it to justify your response. Yes, it is a message of dissemination as in the header we can see that the destination has a broadcast address. This address is the one that has all its bits at 1 which in the mac addresses is translated into FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.\nWhen it comes to you, in this case to whom it has IP address 192.168.1.1 will return the request and in the origin we will get its MAC address.\nDo you think the ARP response is a message of dissemination? Make a Wireshark capture of an ARP response and analyze it to justify your response. We can see in the answer that in the destination direction comes that of the pc that I send the question, so the answer is not a broadcast message but a point-by-point communication.\nThe computers of a network store in memory a cache with the IP-MAC correspondences they know. It explains the process of updating the ARP cache after observing how it is being filled on the machines of a small GNS3 scenario with a local network with four computers connected to a switch. See how the ARP cache of all computers changes when you go ping between one computer and another. When we do a ping the issuer and the receiver \u0026ldquo;add each other to the ARP table\u0026rdquo;, if we consult them in both we will see that they are included:\nWe can see that the time they are kept in cache is 120 seconds, when this time is over, the entrance is deleted.\nWhile in the pcs that have not intervened they will not store anything in the cache arp on the \u0026ldquo;transaction made\u0026rdquo;:\nAnalyze the ip neigh command to see the possibilities it offers and think about what the real use of each of them can be. This command allows us to interact with the arp table where the IP-MAC address ratio is saved. For example, we can view it, add inputs or delete them and modify them. We can also change the time during which a request is saved in the table.\nFor example, list the content:\nWe can summarize your functions:\nShow the full ARP table: ip neighbourhood show Add an entry to the ARP table: ip near add (IP) laddr {MAC} dev {interface} Remove an entry from the ARP table: ip nearby from the {IP} dev {interface} Set the life time of an entry in the ARP table: ip neighbourhood change {IP} dev {interface} nud {state} Search for a specific entry in the ARP table: ip near 124; grep {IP} Basically this is what we need to know to be able to control the ARP tables with the IP command in replacement (or as a complement) to \u0026ldquo;arp.\u0026rdquo;\nFind out what a free ARP is and what the meaning of its existence is. It is a request issued by a device in order to update the arp table of the other devices of a network. It simply informs other network devices of its own IP and MAC address.\nThe main purpose of free ARP is to ensure that all devices on a network have the most up-to-date information possible on the IP and MAC addresses of other devices on the network.\nOne of its utilities is to detect IP\u0026rsquo;s conflicts, \u0026ldquo;this ip is already taken\u0026rdquo; this is because another team has responded with these packages.\nTherefore, from this information this incidence can be resolved.\nExplain with your words what an ARP Spofing attack is based on and how it is carried out. Can it be used as an attack technique from your home to an alien network? How could we defend ourselves against him? The attack changes the flow of data sent from a Victim PC that passes through a Gateway to make a MITM (Man in the Middle) attack by getting the victim\u0026rsquo;s traffic through an Attack machine in a manner that is safe for the victim.\nThus the attacker intercepts the messages and is able to obtain all the traffic from the network by obtaining passwords and confidential or sensitive information.\nThe steps followed by an attacker in carrying out this attack are:\nScanning the network, to get a relationship of the connected devices. Send false arp packages to associate your ip address to your own mac. Once the client has been \u0026ldquo;deceived,\u0026rdquo; the attacker will start intercepting all the traffic. These attacks only occur if the attacker gets access to your local network, so to protect ourselves we can use:\nARP Spofing detection tools. Use a firewall as it is able to block suspicious ARP packages. Use protocols like Ipsec and SSL / TLS. Configure the arp table in a static way. There are two types of switch attacks called MAC Flooding and MAC Spofing. What are they and how can we defend ourselves from them? MAC Flooding consists of filling the arp table of a network device, for example a switch and making it not able to locate to which mouth the traffic goes to if it sends it through all the mouths causing at worst to leave the device out of service.\nTo mitigate this attack it is recommended to set a limit on the size of the ARP table and the detection and blocking of suspicious traffic.\nWhile the MAC Spofing consists of falsifying a MAC address to intercept a particular traffic, it can have access to private content.\nTo mitigate this attack in the event that you supply a machine from my network and have access to content we can implement second factor authentication tools or use digital certificates.\nWe can also implement the following strategies in our network:\nStatic inputs to ARP table\nThe first solution that exists is to work with static routes in network equipment. This allows to invalidate ARP messages, because the IP is associated with a MAC address and this does not change over time. It is a simple and generally applied solution to ensure that the predetermined link door is really that of the network and not an attacker. However, it is a difficult strategy to apply if you have a network with a lot of terminals.\nDHCP snooping\nIt is a strategy that keeps a record of the MAC that are connected in each port and immediately detects if there is a subplanting. Several network equipment manufacturers incorporate this solution into their equipment, such as CISCO.\nDynamic ARP Inspection\nTo prevent the supplanting of ARP (ARP spoofing) and the resulting ARP poisoning (ARP poisoning), a switch should ensure that only ARP Requests and ARP Replies are transmitted valid.\nThe Dynamic ARP / Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) Dynamic Inspection requires DHCP snooping and helps prevent ARP attacks as follows:\nNot transmitting invalid or free / free ARP responses / Replies to other ports in the same VLAN. Intercept all requests / Requests and answers / Replies ARP in unreliable ports. Checking each intercepted package for a valid IP to MAC link. Discard and record invalid ARP responses to prevent ARP poisoning. Error-disabling the interface if you exceed the number of ARP DAI packages configured. RARP RARP is Reversal ARP, which means that you consult the corresponding IP from a MAC address. In case you return more than one IP address, then the MAC has been cloned.\nBibliography ip neigh arp spoofing Free ARP mitigation measures ","date":"September 8, 2023","hero":"/images/redes/arp/portada.png","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/redes/arp/arp/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is fundamental in computer networks to map IP addresses to physical link layer addresses (MAC).

It shows the correct functioning of both VLAN and that there is no connectivity between PC2 and PC3. Can you do it with the Ethernet switches that GNS3 brings? You find any limitations? What are the different types (types) that a port can have and where do they differ?\nTo configure the VLANS in the switches, we right-click and then we make the following configuration:\nFor switch 3 (PC1 and PC2)\nFor switch 2 (PC3 and PC4)\nFor switch (PC5 and NAT1)\nPC1, you will only have connectivity with the PCs that belong to your VLAN:\nPC2, you will only have connectivity with the PCs that belong to your VLAN:\nWith their respective partners from the other switch we will get the same result. PC3, you will only have connectivity with the PCs that belong to your VLAN:\nPC4, you will only have connectivity with the PCs that belong to your VLAN:\nWe have to keep in mind that devices that do not belong to the VLAN 10 must be manually configured as they do not have connectivity to the DHCP server.\nExercise A can do it perfectly with the switches that GNS3 brings, we will find an important limitation, as the switches only allow the mouths to belong to a VLAN.\nIn performing the exercise we must take into account the types that a port can have, the ones we have used are the first two:\nAccess: This is the one for a final team, that is a customer, as it is responsible for removing the labelling that goes on the header. Dot1q: This is in charge of interconnecting network devices with each other, is in charge of adding the labelling in the header to send the package to another device and let it know to which VLAN belongs. QinQ: It is similar to dot1q but it is also in charge of adding the type of package to the label to identify them. With this in mind we can do an analogy with the practice of physical switches: The untagged ports \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Access\nThe ports tagged \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Dot1q\nBy using these switches protocol 802.1Q but \u0026ldquo;with less functions\u0026rdquo; we cannot indicate that VLANS we want you to use the ports configured as Dot1q, but that through the VLAN by default pass the labelled packages of all VLANS.\nExercise B 2 All computers must be able to access the data server, but only PC1 and PC3 must access the Internet. They will do it through your physical machine using the element called NAT, which you will need to understand and configure. Can you do it with the Ethernet switches that GNS3 brings? What limitation do you find? To overcome this limitation, download the CISCO 3725 as application and use it instead of the Ethernet switches by setting them up properly.\nSwitches Ethernet Here we find the first limitation of these switches, as we can only have 1 VLAN per port this means that only a VLAN will have access to these resources.\nAs we want only VLAN 10 to browse the Internet we will set the mouth of our cloud to a mouth with access type and belong to this VLAN:\nSo for this point there is no problem, our PC1 and PC3 will both be able to browse the Internet:\nAs these 2 PCS belong to the same VLAN that the NAT cloud can communicate smoothly and use the DHCP server that includes the same to configure. While PC2 and PC4 cannot navigate or be configured by DHCP by not belonging to the same VLAN as the NAT cloud:\nWith the data server we will run into the limitation as only a port can belong to a VLAN, only a couple of our PCs can communicate. This could be avoided by setting up the server as a \u0026ldquo;real machine\u0026rdquo; with 2 virtual interfaces and telling the switch that each one belongs to a different VLAN.\nCISCO 3725 To start using this device, we will have to add space to the disk so that we can start it, and we can add the 16-mouth Ethernet module by default so we won\u0026rsquo;t have to do it by hand later.\nTo make this configuration we must have imported the router and access Edit \u0026gt; preferences \u0026gt; IOS routers.\nOnce the template is modified, we will place the 3725 on the stage and set up the same scenario:\nWe must bear in mind that the FastEthernet0/0 and FastEthernet0/1 interfaces work as routers, that is, we cannot use them as switch. The ports that behave as a switch are all of FastEthernet1 so it will be the ones we use.\nWe will then tell these ports that they have to work as if they were a switch for it we will introduce the following commands in each of the 3725.\nWe will now create the vlans using the following commands, for each of the switches:\nWe can list them with the following command:\nWe will now assign your corresponding VLAN to the ports:\nThen we will configure the port that unites the two 3725, for this we put it in trunk mode and allow the encapsulated traffic of all the VLANS through this port.\nFinally, we will save the changes so that if the equipment is turned off, it will maintain the modifications we have made:\nWith this we will have configured the first 3725, its homologue to this, that is to say the one that connects to PC3 and PC4, we would have to do the same adapted to the ports in which the devices are connected.\nWe will continue to configure the 3725 that unites both \u0026ldquo;switches\u0026rdquo; and gives output to the data server and the Internet. For this we will create VLANS 10 and 20:\nAnd we will assign both VLANs to the data server, while only VLAN 10 will be assigned to the internet connection.\nWe will now set up the interfaces that interconnect the switches:\nThen we will create the two subintrants to allow traffic between them and we will assign you ip addresses.\nNow the data server will connect it to the Fe0/0 port and in it will create two subintrants, I will use a debian machine. This will be done by editing it on network interfaces:\nWe check that the interfaces are up:\nWe will now create the routing routes:\nOnce this is done, we can do ping to the data server from the two interfaces:\nWe can ping the data server and we will have connectivity with the:\nWe see that the traffic is able to reach the data server however it is not able to \u0026ldquo;make the way back.\u0026rdquo;\nI have also set up inter vlan routing, following the links of the literature but it has not worked for me either.\nExercise C It answers the following questions on the above paragraphs:\nC.1 What about the direction when you add the NAT cloud? What is the reason for this change?\nWhen we put the NAT cloud, it includes a DHCP server which has the address ip 192.168.122.1 and assigns addresses to the network 192.168.122.1/24. Through the configuration provided by this will allow us to browse the Internet.\nC.2 Why is it necessary to assign a hard drive to each of the devices and what minimum size should it have for the scenario to work?\nFor the 3725 cisco routers, for it to start and exceed the initial check it must have at least 1MB space, and if we want to save the settings this will be necessary. For example to save the information of the vlans it will be necessary.\n**C.3 What is the difference between setting up a switch port in mode **access **and mode **trunk and when each of them should be used?\nThe access mode is designed to connect a final client that is, a pc. It is the equivalent of the \u0026ldquo;untagged port,\u0026rdquo; however this has a limitation which is that it can only belong to a van, this port is also in charge of removing the header that the trunk ports add so that the final devices can understand the packages.\nOn the other hand, the trunk mode allows to connect a network device to another, for example a switch to another switch, would be the equivalent of a \u0026ldquo;tagged port,\u0026rdquo; this also allows the traffic of several vlans, tagging the tracks so that the other devices can interpret the VLAN to which the package belongs.\nExercise D **Now replace PC1 and PC3 with two machines **Linux with Firefox installed (you can find the images in the GNSS Market Place) and check that they navigate correctly.\nWe added it to the stage and connected them to the same mouths that our VPCS had to maintain the previous configuration of the VLANS and have access to the NAT cloud.\nOnce this is done, we will access the machine interface and configure your network card by DHCP, so we will access the control panel:\nIn the control panel we access network to configure the network:\nIn the network panel we will say to use DHCP and save the configuration:\nIn the terminal we can make sure that the network configuration has been performed correctly.\nAnd we can see that by doing this procedure we can already navigate with the tinycore with Firefox:\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the test with the second tiny core:\nExercise E Set up a Port Bonding between the header switch and the other two. It shows its proper functioning and explains in detail how you set it up. Explain the lags that a carrier can have.\nThen we must set up the extra ports we have added to the stage to be in trunk mode and respect our scenario with the VLANS, is to repeat what we have done before.\nThe first thing we will have to do will be to create the logical interfaces, however this step can be omitted as later if the interface does not exist it will automatically create it.\nWe will indicate that interfaces we want them to belong to the port-channel 1 for the logical link between R1-R2 and to belong to the port-channel 2 for the logical link between R2-R3.\nFor R1-R2:\nFor R2-R1:\nFor R2-R3:\nFor R3-R2:\nWe can also configure the EtherChannel as a trunk link, and so we get statistical multiplexation of the traffic of the VLANs and that when one link falls it still works with both VLANs. We will do this with all the logical links:\nOnce this is done we can check if the etherchannels are working:\nThe EtherChannel configuration can be done using one of these protocols: Port Aggregation Protocol (PagP) or Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). Both ends must be configured in the same way.\nThese have a series of \u0026ldquo;modes\u0026rdquo; in which the behaviour of the port will change when creating links:\non: In this mode, group member links will be added manually and not automatically monitored. This mode is used when you want to have greater control over group member links. desirable: In this way, the switch will try to negotiate with the connected device at the other end of the link. If the other end device is also configured in \u0026ldquo;desirable\u0026rdquo; mode, the link will be automatically added. car: In this mode, the switch will not attempt to negotiate but will automatically add the link if the connected device at the other end of the link is configured in \u0026ldquo;desirable\u0026rdquo; mode. active: In this mode, the switch will constantly send LACP PDUs to determine whether the connected device at the other end of the link is available and also configured to use LACP. If the other end device is available and also configured to use LACP, the link will be automatically added. Exercise F Port Mirroring: Connects a PC5 to Switch1 and monitors the traffic leaving PC1. It makes a Wireshark capture in the PC5 mouth and explains the traffic captured.\nThe first thing we will do is set up the port mirroring, in my case will send the traffic from the 1 / 5 mouth to the 1 / 4.\nI will make the pc5 a ping to google and monitor the cable that goes from the router to pc4, to check that the port mirroring is working:\nWe see that we have been able to \u0026ldquo;intercept\u0026rdquo; a ping, coming from the ip6 address.\nThis will make the incoming and outgoing traffic from the port we have put as a sniffer send it back to the port we hear.\nWe can check the status of the port viewing session with this command:\nBibliography Switching and GNS3 The NAT node Simulando switch cisco en GNS3 GNS3, adding hosts to our topologies Working with switch in GNS3: VLAN and Trunk LACP and PAGP InterVLAN routing VLAN routing Configure Port Bonding Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) and Port Aggregation Protocol (PAGP) Wiki EtherChannel Inter VLAN Communication ","date":"September 8, 2023","hero":"/images/redes/switches_gns3/portada.png","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/redes/switches_gns3/configuracion_de_switches_en_gns3/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou will learn to configure switches in GNS3, both generic devices and Cisco switches, using the VLans concept to segment the network and explore the complexities of network management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"stage-preparation\"\u003eStage preparation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing I\u0026rsquo;ll do is set up the stage:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/redes/switches_gns3/img/Aspose.Words.1880b7c0-3050-4e53-a32a-505911fdf872.001.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"customer-network-configuration\"\u003eCustomer network configuration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen set up the network cards of the customers, taking advantage that the NAT cloud includes a DHCP server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo do this, we write on the VPCS the following command:\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["Redes","Wireshark","GNS3","Cisco","Switches"],"title":"GNS3 switch configuration"},{"categories":null,"contents":" **This post was developed for Debian 11.

Introduction Wireshark is a protocol analyzer used to analyse and solve problems in communications networks, for data and protocol analysis, and as a didactic tool.\nAdd a graphic interface and many organization and filtering options. So, it allows you to see all the traffic that passes through a network by setting the configuration in promiscuous mode of our network card. It also includes a text-based version called tshark.\nIt allows you to examine data or a saved capture file on disk. The information captured can be analysed through the details and summaries for each package. Wireshark includes a complete language to filter what we want to see and the ability to show the reconstructed flow of a TCP session.\nWireshark is free software, and runs on most Unix and compatible operating systems.\nThe minimum requirements for using this software are:\nAny modern AMD64 /x86-64 64 bit or 32 bit x86 processor. 500 MB RAM available. The larger capture files require more RAM. 500 MB of available disk space. Capture files require additional disk space. Any modern screen. A resolution of 1280 × 1024 or more is recommended. Wireshark will use HiDPI or Retina resolutions if available. Advanced users will find several monitors useful. A compatible network card to capture 1.1 Download the package in due To download the package on our computer we will need to look at the official page downloads if it includes support for our operating system.\nWe see that no GNU/Linux operating system appears on the list, this is because Wireshark is available through the default packaging system on most of these platforms. That is to say this present in the repositories of our distribution, in the event that it is not there we have the source code as a free software and we could compile it.\nWe can check if it is available in our operating system by visiting the official page:\nWe see that Debian appears on the list this means that the package is in the official repository of due.\nIn Debian we have the apt package manager, so we can check the version of the package available for installation and check from when repositories are downloaded with the following command:\nTo perform the wireshark installation we will enter the following command:\nThen to make network catches on the equipment we will need permissions for our user to do so, we will use the following command:\n1.2 Operating check We will now open the program to check that everything works properly:\nNow we will start a package capture for it if we want to do it on a specific interface we press on it, in my case I will use the wlo1 wireless network card and I will make a web request to the jagger.es page.\nHere I show you the DNS request that has traveled from my laptop to the router.\n1.3 General wireshark components Wireshark makes use of certain packages:\n**Wireshark:**the network protocol analyzer we all know. **TShark:**a command line network protocol analyzer. **Supplements and extensions:**extras for Wireshark and TShark dissection engines **Dissector supplements:**supplements with some extended dissections. Complements of tree statistics: Extended statistics. **Mate:**monitoring engine and meta analysis: user-configurable extensions of the screen filter engine; see Chapter 12, MATE for more details. **MIB **of SNMP: SNMP MIB for a more detailed SNMP dissection. **Tools:**additional command line tools to work with capture files **Editcap:**reads a capture file and writes some or all of the packages in another capture file. **Text2Pcap:**reads an ASCII hexadecimal overflow and writes the data in a pcap capture file. **Reordercap:**reorders a capture file by time mark. **Mergecap:**combines several captured files saved in a single output file. **Capingos:**provides information about the capture files. Rawshark: unprocessed package filter. **User guide:**local user guide installation. The Help buttons in most dialog boxes will require an Internet connection to show the help pages if the User Guide is not installed locally. 2 Installation of GNS3 in Debian 11 2.1 Introduction GNS3 is a graphical network simulator launched in 2008, which allows you to design complex network topologies and launch simulations on them, allowing the combination of both real and virtual devices.\nTo complete simulations, GNS3 is closely linked to:\n**Dynamipes:**an IOS emulator that allows users to run IOS images. **Dynagen:**a text-based front-end for Dynamips. Qemuand **VirtualBox:**to allow the use of virtual machines such as a PIX firewall or workstations. **VPCS:**a PC emulator with basic networking functions. IOU:(IOS in Unix), special IOS compilations provided by Cisco to run directly on UNIX systems and derivatives. The minimum requirements for making use of this tool are:\n**Processor:**2 or more logical cores **Virtualization:**Virtualization extensions are required. You may need to enable this through your computer\u0026rsquo;s BIOS. **RAM memory:**4 GB RAM **Storage:**1 GB of available space (Windows installation is \u0026lt; 200 MB). **Additional notes:**You may need additional storage for your operating system and device images. 2.2 Installation The first thing we will do before we install will be to check that our system is up-to-date, so we will make an apt update and if we have outdated packages we will make an apt upgrade.\nBelow we will install all the units you need GNS3:\nI will now describe the function of the packages that we will install:\nPackage Description python3-pip The pip module is the package installer for Python. python3-pyqt5 The PyQt5 module exposes the Qt5 API to Python 3. python3-pyqt5.qtsvg The PyQt5 SVG module provides classes for displaying the contents of SVG files. python3-pyqt5.qtwebsockets The PyQt5 WebSockets module provides Python 3 bindings for the WebSockets specification (both client and server). qemu Virtualization software, currently divided into several packages. qemu-kvm Full system emulation binaries for QEMU. qemu-utils Utilities for QEMU emulation. libvirt-clients Libvirt is a set of C tools for interacting with the virtualization capabilities of recent Linux versions. libvirt-daemon-system This package contains configuration files to run the libvirt daemon as a system service. virtinst This package contains command-line utilities for creating and editing virtual machines. wireshark A network analyzer that captures packets for further analysis. xtightvncviewer A remote display system that allows you to view a \u0026lsquo;desktop\u0026rsquo; environment not only on the machine where it is running but from anywhere on the Internet. apt-transport-https This is a dummy transitional package: support for HTTPS. ca-certificates Contains the certificates of the certificate authorities included in the Mozilla browser to enable SSL-based applications. curl curl is a command-line tool for transferring data with URL syntax. gnupg2 Can be used to encrypt data and create digital signatures. It includes an advanced key management feature and complies with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard. software-properties-common Allows you to easily manage your distribution and software sources from independent software vendors. Once these packages are installed, we will download GNS3 using pip3:\nWe will also look at the command output to check for any errors:\nThe following will be to install docker, which will allow us to create containers. For this we will import your GPG key so that our system trusted the:\nThe following will be to add the repository to our system for this we will use the following command:\nWe will update the repositories you use apt by making an apt update:\nAnd we can finally install docker:\nAdd the following lines to your /etc/apt/sources.list, so that we can install dynamps and ubridge:\nIn order to install the necessary packages of these repositories, we will add the gpg keys of it:\nWe will update the repositories you use apt by making an apt update:\nWe will install the Dynamips and ubridge packages:\nA box like this will come out to indicate if users who are not superusers can capture packages, we will tell you that if in our case:\nTo avoid accidental installation of anything else in that repository (for now), delete or comment those two lines in your /etc/apt/sources.list file and make an apt update:\nWe can also remove the GPG key from these repositories if we want to:\nWe will add users who will use the tool to the following groups:\nReset your user session by closing and relaunching it, or by relaunching the system to apply these changes.\n2.3 Our first topology in GNS3 Once the system is restarted, we will start the application, and we will get a box like this:\nHere we will indicate that I will run the applications locally in my machine. Below we will select the server route, host name and associated port:\nIf everything has been right, he will tell us that it has been done correctly:\nWhen we open the program, it will give us a choice to create a project or we can create a new one, in my case I will create one:\nIf we look at the left side of the program, we will see the following symbols, which serve the following purposes:\nWe will add by dragging 2 VPCS:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll add an Ethernet swicht:\nWe will click on the Add a link button to stop adding links, so we would have the scenario:\nWe can make visible the interface to which we have connected them by clicking on the following button:\nThe green \u0026ldquo;Play\u0026rdquo; button in the GNS3 toolbar will power on all devices in the topology, while the yellow \u0026ldquo;Pause\u0026rdquo; button will suspend them, and the red \u0026ldquo;Stop\u0026rdquo; button will power off everything in the topology.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll get a warning, so we can confirm if we want to add all the devices, we\u0026rsquo;ll give you if:\nWe will see that both left in the device summary and in the outgoing connections of the devices their state \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; to changed from red to green, since these are now on:\nWe will now open a terminal on all of our VPCS with the following button:\nThrough these terminals we will assign ips addresses to our devices with the following command:\nOnce the network cards are configured, we will check for connectivity between them by doing a ping:\nWe will add a third VPCS to our scheme:\nWe will turn it on and open a terminal to configure it as we have done with the above:\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ll check that this new machine has connectivity to the above:\nIf we want to save our equipment settings we will enter the save command:\n2.4 Internet access via NAT on GNS3 The easiest way to get access to the Internet is through the NAT cloud.\nThis has Internet access as well as a DHCP service running with IPV4. To make use of it, we will put it on our stage and connect it on a swicht.\nThen if we want to get out on the Internet, we will have to set up our customers to get them the right network configuration. We\u0026rsquo;ll take advantage we have a DHCP server.\nFor customers to configure through this service we will enter the dhcp command:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll try to do a ping to google.es to check the connectivity:\n3 Common problems in installation 3.1 VPCS error exectable version must be \u0026gt; = 0.6.1 but not 0.8 This error comes when installing the VPCS, a version that does not currently support the program is downloaded from the repositories.\nLuckily it is very easy to solve, we will access the repository of the developer in github and we will download the following package:\nOnce downloaded we will uncompress it using the following command:\nWhere we do this command will create a directory in which we will access to compile the program:\nWe will run the following script:\nThe vpcs directory will create us on this route, this one will have to be added in gns3:\nWe will access gns3, press CTRL + SHIFT + P to access the preference panel. Once here we move to the vpcs section and select the directory route we just generated:\nWe applied the changes and we could already use the vpcs.\n3.2 Xterm not installed This error appears when we want to access a console of a device of our network typology. To solve this problem the first thing is to close GNS3 and then direct to a terminal to download it, we will use the following command:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll reopen the program and we can access the consoles of our machines.\n4 Install IOS images If we want to add to our real hardware system as can be a swan router for example we must access the official GNS3 page and download specifically the one we want to add in my case I will add a swan 3725.\nIf we click on the download button we will download an extension file, which is a template.\nIf you look at this case we do not have the possibility to download the image from this repository, it tells us that there is no link available. For these cases there is a cisco repository which has all the images of its products \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; tfr.org/cisco-ios\nTo find out which one to get from here, we will open gns3 and through the top left menu we will click on the file \u0026gt; import applilance section, select the template that we will import. We will give you to install on our local computer:\nOnce here we are, we will see the name of the file and search it in the external repository, as we can see that the file is not found\nIn this case I will download, this version that matches the template I have downloaded:\nWhen we have done this we will have the following problem, the image signatures will not match to mitigate that step we will mark the option allow custom files at the bottom and import the binary we have just downloaded:\nPlease inform us that for the selected template, the file we downloaded from the repository does not match the hashes. In our case it is normal since the image is not the same as it would have to come with the template, so we will accept the risks.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll see you change the state to ready to install, so we\u0026rsquo;ll give you the next on the bottom.\nYou will ask us for confirmation to add our device, we will confirm the action:\nPlease inform us that our device has been added to the router templates for this case.\nAlso inform us of the name given to you.\nAs I tell us, we\u0026rsquo;ll find it in the routers section:\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ll do a little running test, add it to our stage and check that we can start it and connect to the console:\n\u0026lsquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll see the connection to the console is correct:\n5 Installation on GNSS Windows 5.1 Packages needed for Windows Even if we have installed the GNS3 software it will make use of additional packages to perform some functions or even add new features such as emulating routers of certain manufacturers.\nArticle Required Description WinPCAP Required Required to connect GNS3 to your computer network. Used by Cloud and NAT nodes to allow your projects to communicate with the outside world. Npcap Optional The modern replacement for WinPCAP, known to solve issues but is less tested than WinPCAP. Install Npcap with the \u0026ldquo;Support WinPcap API mode\u0026rdquo; option selected if used without WinPcap. Npcap can coexist with WinPcap if that option is not selected. Wireshark Recommended Allows you to capture and view network traffic sent between nodes. Dynamips Required Required to run a local GNS3 installation with Cisco routers. QEMU 3.1.0 and 0.11.0 Optional Virtualization software. The older version of Qemu 0.11.0 is installed to support legacy ASA devices. It is recommended to use the GNS3 VM instead. VPCS Recommended A very lightweight PC emulator that supports basic commands like ping and traceroute. Cpulimit Optional Used to prevent QEMU from using 100% of your CPU (when running) in some cases, such as with legacy ASA devices. GNS3 Required The main GNS3 software. This is always mandatory. TightVNC Viewer Recommended A VNC client used to connect to device graphical user interfaces. Solar-Putty Recommended The new default console application. Virt-viewer Recommended Alternative viewer for Qemu desktop virtual machines that have qemu-spice preinstalled. Intel Hardware Acceleration Manager (HAXM) Optional Only available on systems with Intel CPUs (and VT-X enabled) that are not using Hyper-V. Used for hardware acceleration of Android emulation as well as QEMU. 5.2. Minimum requirements For small environments on Windows developers require to have at least the following features:\nFeature Requirements Operating System Windows 7 (64-bit) or later Processor 2 or more logical cores Virtualization Virtualization extensions are required. You may need to enable this in your computer\u0026rsquo;s BIOS. Memory 4 GB of RAM Storage 1 GB of available space (Windows installation is \u0026lt; 200 MB). 5.3 GNSS 3 installation The first thing that we will have to download the official executable of your website, for this we will have to be registered in advance.\nWe will launch the executable and ask for the permission of the administration, we will grant them:\nA screen will come out informing us about the product, we give it to next.\nWe will then have to accept the terms and licences for use:\nYou will ask us where we want to create the shortcuts of the program, I will leave it by default as this will add them to the desktop:\nNext, we need to pay close attention because we must select local installation and all the packages we intend to use. If we have already installed any of them beforehand, we should uncheck them (those mentioned in section 5.1).\nWe will select the route where the program is installed, I will leave the default. It also informs us of the space required by the installation:\nWe will wait for the installation:\nWinCap installation\nRequired to connect GNS3 to your computer network. Used by the Cloud and NAT nodes to allow their projects to communicate with the outside world.\nAs the installation of GNS3 is carried out, the installation of all the programs we have previously marked will begin.\nIt will show us information about the program this first window so we give you the following:\nWe accept the license of terms and use:\nWe mark the option for you to automatically boot the driver and we give you to install\nIt informs us that the installation was correct and we close the window:\nNcap installation\nThe modern WinPCAP replacement can solve problems but is less proven than WinPCAP.Instale Npcap with the selected \u0026ldquo;WinPcap API-compatible mode\u0026rdquo; option, if used without WinPcap.Npcap can coexist with WinPcap, if that option is not selected.\nAgain the same process, we accept the terms and licenses of use.\nWe leave the default marked option and give it to install\nWhen the installation is finished we give you the following:\nAnd we close the installer:\nWe return to GNS3 because the installation process was paused while we installed the components it will use. It will resume automatically.\nOnce the installation is finished, we give you the next\nGNS3 offers us a free Solarwinds license, we will give you if:\nWe will have successfully completed the installation of GNS3\nWe will open the program and select to run the devices in our local machine:\nHere we will configure our local GNSS server 3\nPreviously leave it by default, if our configuration is correct, it will tell us that the connection has been performed successfully:\nIt will show us a summary of the configuration given above:\n5.4 Operating test We will set up the same scenario as in debian to check its operation, the process is the same.\nWe will set up the ips addresses of the machines and check that they have connectivity through solarputty.\nPC1:\nPC2:\nWe can see that both teams have connectivity across the stage.\n6 Wireshark installation on Windows 6.1 Installation The installation of this product is very simple, if we have installed GNS3 previously and marked the box of this, we will have been installed automatically.\nOn the contrary, if we start from scratch we can do your installation, let\u0026rsquo;s get it off your official website:\nWhen we open the installer you will ask us for administrator\u0026rsquo;s permissions, we will grant it to you:\nIf, like I installed it with GNS3, we were to find that there is already one installed, so I will cancel it.\nIf we didn\u0026rsquo;t have it the installation is identical to any program we have installed in practice. Here I show you, the first thing you\u0026rsquo;ll see is an executable information screen:\nLike all programs you will be asked to accept the terms and conditions of use:\nWe will select the products we want to install in my case all:\nIt will also ask us to access them directly and where we want to create them.\nWe will select the route where we want it to be installed:\nWe will select if we are interested in the Ncap package. (We have installed it with GNS3)\nNext you will ask us to install the extension that allows us to analyze USB traffic, in my case the desmarcare as I am not interested.\nWe will wait for the installation to complete and give you the following:\nPlease inform us that the installation has been properly performed:\n6.2 Operating test I have made a DNS request to www.sevillafc.es and here we can see the DNS consultation:\n7 GNSS VM If we want to deploy virtual machines in a virtual instance we will deploy the virtual machine that gives us GNS3 to carry the Virtualization charge.\nWe will download the OVA from the official website\nOnce downloaded we will import it into Vmware and give you the hardware features we consider appropriate:\nOnce I do this we will open GNS3 and edit the preferences of GNSS VM and select the virtual machine that we just imported:\nWe will start the virtual machine and we can see the data from it in the info tab:\nWe will launch the set-up wizard from the GNS3 help tab and select the option to run the stacks in a virtual machine:\nWe will select the configuration of our virtual machine:\nWe will again select our virtual machine and the hardware features we want:\nWe would only have to import the devices into the virtual machine, this does just like we did before changing the place where we imported it:\nIf we want to see where a device will run we can see it through preferences:\nWe can also see in section servers sumarry the resource consumption of our machines:\n8 Conclusion We can see that the installation is infinitely more comfortable on Windows as it automatically installs your dependencies, being the typical \u0026ldquo;next to next\u0026rdquo; installation.\nAlso on Windows when the installation was finished the product was ready to use and I have not suffered any errors when starting the program or using its features as if it happened to me in Debian.\n9 Bibliography Official documentation Wireshark Debian Wireshark package Minimum Wireshark requirements Error \u0026ldquo;VPCS executable version must be \u0026gt;= 0.6.1 but not 0.8\u0026rdquo; VPCS download ","date":"September 8, 2023","hero":"/images/redes/instalacion_wireshark_gns3/portada_instalacion_wireshark_gns3.png","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/redes/instalacion_wireshark_gns3/instalacion-gns3-y-wireshark/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**This post was developed for Debian 11.

You can ignore this for now as we will configure it next.\nConfiguring the isc-dhcp-server service First, we need to configure the network interface that the DHCP server will operate on. Edit the interface configuration file:\nsudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server Add the interface that will distribute IP addresses, for example for network1:\nINTERFACESv4=\u0026#34;ens5\u0026#34; Then we configure the DHCP server with the following characteristics:\nIP address range: 192.168.10.100 - 192.168.0.110 Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 Lease duration: 1 hour Gateway: 192.168.10.1 DNS servers: 8.8.8.8 Edit the isc-dhcp-server configuration file:\nsudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf The most important parameters inside this file are:\nmax-lease-time: IP address lease time default-lease-time: Lease renewal time option routers: Gateway IP address option domain-name-server: IP addresses of the DNS servers the client will use option domain-name: Domain name sent to the client option subnet-mask: Subnet sent to the clients option broadcast-address: Network broadcast address Here is the configuration I will add for network1:\nsubnet 192.168.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { range 192.168.10.100 192.168.10.110; option routers 192.168.10.1; option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8; default-lease-time 3600; max-lease-time 3600; } With this configuration, the DHCP server will provide addresses within the specified range and assign the specified gateway and DNS server.\nTo apply the changes, restart the DHCP service:\nsudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server Configuring clients to obtain dynamic addresses To allow clients to receive IP addresses dynamically, ensure their network settings are set to use DHCP.\nOn a Debian client Edit the network configuration to use DHCP. Open the /etc/network/interfaces file:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces Ensure the interface is configured like this:\nauto ens4 iface ens4 inet dhcp Restart the network interface to apply changes:\ndebian@client1:~$ sudo ifdown ens4 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo ifup ens4 You should see the DHCP client\u0026rsquo;s output as it obtains its configuration:\nifdown: interface ens4 not configured Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client 4.4.3-P1 ... bound to 192.168.10.100 -- renewal in 1479 seconds.

GRE Tunnels GRE is an unsecured site-to-site VPN tunneling protocol that can encapsulate a wide variety of protocol packets within IP tunnels. This allows an organization to transmit other protocols over an IP-based WAN.\nThis allows adding an IPv4 header to an IPv6 packet so it can travel over IPv4 networks.\nR1 → R3 We will create a tunnel interface:\nGRE Tunnel Configuration with IPv6 over IPv4 We set the tunnel mode to GRE with IP, which will encapsulate our IPv6 packets within IPv4:\nWe assign an IPv4 address to our tunnel:\nWe set the WAN address of our router, FastEthernet 1/0:\nWe set the WAN address of the tunnel endpoint (R2):\nWe enable OSPF, which is a dynamic routing protocol:\nThis command adds the tunnel network to OSPF:\nWe assign an IPv6 address to our tunnel, with the network prefix 2002 based on the router\u0026rsquo;s IPv4 address 2002:0A00:0001::1/64:\nWe create the route to reach the network:\nWe create a tunnel interface:\nWe set the tunnel mode to GRE with IP, which will encapsulate our IPv6 packets within IPv4:\nWe assign an IPv4 address to our tunnel:\nWe set the WAN address of our router, FastEthernet 1/0:\nWe set the WAN address of the tunnel endpoint (R2):\nWe enable OSPF, which is a dynamic routing protocol:\nThis command adds the tunnel network to OSPF:\nWe assign an IPv6 address to our tunnel, with the network prefix 2002 based on the router\u0026rsquo;s IPv4 address 2002:0A00:0002::1/64:\nWe create the route to reach the network:\nWe create a tunnel interface:\nWe set the tunnel mode to GRE with IP, which will encapsulate our IPv6 packets within IPv4:\nWe assign an IPv4 address to our tunnel:\nWe set the WAN address of our router, FastEthernet 1/0:\nWe set the WAN address of the tunnel endpoint (R2):\nWe enable OSPF, which is a dynamic routing protocol:\nThis command adds the tunnel network to OSPF:\nWe assign an IPv6 address to our tunnel, with the network prefix 2002 based on the router\u0026rsquo;s IPv4 address 2002:1400:0001:\nWe create the route to reach the network:\nR3 → R1 We create a tunnel interface:\nWe set the tunnel mode to GRE with IP, which will encapsulate our IPv6 packets within IPv4:\nWe assign an IPv4 address to our tunnel:\nWe set the WAN address of our router, FastEthernet 1/0:\nWe set the WAN address of the tunnel endpoint (R2):\nWe enable OSPF, which is a dynamic routing protocol:\nThis command adds the tunnel network to OSPF:\nWe assign an IPv6 address to our tunnel, with the network prefix 2002 based on the router\u0026rsquo;s IPv4 address 2002:1400:0002::1/64:\nWe create the route to reach the network:\nR3 → R2 We create a tunnel interface:\nWe set the tunnel mode to GRE with IP, which will encapsulate our IPv6 packets within IPv4:\nWe assign an IPv4 address to our tunnel:\nWe set the WAN address of our router, FastEthernet 1/0:\nWe set the WAN address of the tunnel endpoint (R2):\nWe enable OSPF, which is a dynamic routing protocol:\nThis command adds the tunnel network to OSPF:\nWe assign an IPv6 address to our tunnel, with the network prefix 2002 based on the router\u0026rsquo;s IPv4 address 30.0.0.2 → 2002:1e00:0002::1/64:\nWe create the route to reach the network:\nR2 → R3 We create a tunnel interface:\nWe set the tunnel mode to GRE with IP, which will encapsulate our IPv6 packets within IPv4:\nWe assign an IPv4 address to our tunnel:\nWe set the WAN address of our router, FastEthernet 1/0:\nWe set the WAN address of the tunnel endpoint (R2):\nWe enable OSPF, which is a dynamic routing protocol:\nThis command adds the tunnel network to OSPF:\nWe assign an IPv6 address to our tunnel, with the network prefix 2002 based on the router\u0026rsquo;s IPv4 address 30.0.0.1 → 2002:1e00:0001::1/64:\nWe create the route to reach the network:\n3. Functionality Verification We will verify that the tunnels have been created. To do this, we will enter the following command on the three routers in our scenario:\nThis will appear once both ends of the tunnel have been created. If not, nothing will appear. In our case, we can see that the tunnels have been successfully created.\nPing We will verify the functionality of the tunnels by performing a ping.\nPC1 → 3333:db7::e60:ddff:fea6:0 PC2 → 3333:db7:1:0:e2e:3bff:fe83:0 PC3 → 3333:db7:2:0:e62:5dff:fedf:0 PC1 → PC2\nPC1 → PC3\nPC2 → PC1\nPC2 → PC3\nPC3 → PC1\nPC3 → PC2\nWe can see that we have connectivity between all the machines in our scenario using IPv6, even though we have to traverse IPv4 networks.\nTraceroute We will verify the path that the packets follow.\nPath of a packet from PC1 to PC2:\nPath of a packet from PC1 to PC3:\nPath of a packet from PC2 to PC1:\nPath of a packet from PC2 to PC3:\nPath of a packet from PC3 to PC1:\nPath of a packet from PC3 to PC2:\n4. Study of an Encapsulated Packet Before Passing Through the Tunnel\nA packet traveling from PC1 to PC2.\nWe can see that, since it has not yet passed through the tunnel, it does not have IPv4 headers, only IPv6. We can see that the source is PC1 and the destination is PC3:\nWe will see how, in the next segment, once it passes through the tunnel, the router will add an IPv4 header so it can traverse that segment.\nAfter Passing Through the Tunnel If we look at a packet that has passed through a tunnel, we can see that it has \u0026ldquo;2 network layers\u0026rdquo;:\nIf we look at the network layer, we see that the source and destination IPs are those of the tunnel endpoints. Additionally, we see that it uses protocol 47, which means it has passed through a GRE tunnel.\nFinally, we can see in the IPv6 header that it is indistinguishable from one that has not passed through a tunnel.\nOnce It Reaches the Destination Network We see that, once it reaches the destination (i.e., after traversing the IPv4 segment and re-entering the IPv6 network), the router will remove the IPv4 header and leave the IPv6 header so the packet can reach its destination.\nWe see that the IPv6 header remains intact; it is the same throughout the packet\u0026rsquo;s journey:\n6to4 Tunnels in Linux 1. Network Interface Configuration I will respect the IPv4 addresses from the Cisco scenario.\nR1 To apply the configuration, we will run sudo systemctl restart networking.service.\nI will configure SLAAC to set up the clients on our IPv6 network. First, we need to install the radvd package with sudo apt install radvd.\nOnce the service is configured, we will restart radvd, and our clients will automatically configure themselves with the specified prefix.\nR2 To apply the configuration, we will run sudo systemctl restart networking.service.\nI will configure SLAAC to set up the clients on our IPv6 network.

First, we need to install the radvd package with sudo apt install radvd.\nOnce the service is configured, we will restart radvd, and our clients will automatically configure themselves with the specified prefix.\nNote: In this scenario, it is not necessary to manually configure IPv4 routes, as the network interface configuration will make IPv4 traffic routable.\nHowever, it will be necessary to enable the forwarding bit for both IPv4 and IPv6 on all routers.\nTo do this, we edit the file sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf and uncomment the following lines:\nWe will repeat this for each of our routers and reboot to apply the changes.\n2. SIT Tunnel Configuration The operation is similar to GRE tunnels in Cisco. This will take our packets and, through a tunnel interface, add an IPv4 header so they can traverse IPv4 networks.\nOnce the tunnel is up, we will tell the router that to reach the prefix of network X, it must use this tunnel to add the header to our packets.\nFor convenience, I have created a small script on each router with the necessary commands to make the tunnel work.\nIt consists of 4 commands:\nIt will create the tunnel interface with the destination and then the source. It will bring up the network interface. It will assign the IPv6 address to the tunnel based on the source IPv4 address. We will create the route for the traffic that will use the tunnel. We can name the tunnel as we wish. In my case, I have named it tunnel followed by a number to identify them.\nR2 Tunnels This is what the \u0026ldquo;script\u0026rdquo; for R2 tunnels would look like:\nOnce the script is created, we will give it permissions and execute it:\nWe will verify that the interfaces have been created correctly:\nR3 Tunnels This is what the \u0026ldquo;script\u0026rdquo; for R3 tunnels would look like:\nOnce the script is created, we will give it permissions and execute it:\nWe will verify that the interfaces have been created correctly:\n3.

Each process has its own unique identifier (PID) and is composed of a set of resources, such as memory and CPU, that allow it to operate independently.\nIn the Linux universe, effective process management is a crucial ability to optimize performance and ensure system stability. This post will immerse you in the essential foundations of process management\nPS If we do not add any parameters, ps will show the user processes with which we are logged. On the other hand, the most basic parameters known are:\naux: List the processes of all users with added information (we highlight below).\n-a List the processes of all users.\n-u List process information such as the running user, CPU use and memory, etc.\n-x List processes of all terminals and users\n-l It shows information that includes the UID and the \u0026ldquo;nice\u0026rdquo; value.\n\u0026ndash;forest It shows the process listing in a tree-type format that allows you to see how processes interact with each other, it could be something similar to the pstree command.\nPSTREE The pstree program provides information on the completion of a number of related processes, that is, all the descendants of a particular process. The program makes it clear from the beginning that the process is primary and secondary. This avoids looking for the relationships between the various processes manually.\ncommonly used parameters:\n-H: If we are interested we can see the tree of a specific process:\n-g: Group processes:\n-n: Allows us to order the output by the PID number:\n-p: Shows the PID number\n-s: Shows parent processes\nSYSTEMCTL STATUS This command is used to see the state of a service, specifically, shows information on whether the service or unit is active or inactive, and whether it is in operation or in detention. It also shows any error or warning message related to the service or unit. This command is useful to verify the status of a service or unit in the system and to solve related problems.\nTOP It is a all-in-one program: simultaneously it performs the functions of ps and kill. It\u0026rsquo;s a console command, so you should start it from a terminal.\nWithin this we can control it using the following keys:\n-k: This command is used to send a signal to a process. Then top will ask you about the process PID, followed by the number of the signal to be sent (predetermined TERM - or 15);\n-M: this command is used to order the listing of the processes according to the memory they use (field% MEM);\n-P: this command is used for\norder the list of processes according to the CPU time they consume (field% CPU; this is the default method of ordering);\n-u: This command is used to show the processes of a particular user, top will ask you which one. You must enter the user name.\n-i: this command acts as a switch; predetermined all processes, even those that are asleep, are displayed; this command ensures that only the processes that are in the course of execution are shown:\nHTOP Htop is the improved and current version of top which has a more friendly interface and more functionalities which will help us to monitor processes. This is divided into several parts:\nThe header divides the top of the interface into left and right sections. These show the use of CPU / memory, exchange space, machine activity time, tasks and average load.\nThe upper left section shows a line for each CPU core. For example, the previous screen capture shows two CPU cores, with the percentage that represents the load in each.\nYou can also see the color code provided by htop to identify what type of processes the CPU uses:\nRed: percentage occupied by system processes Blue: percentage occupied by low priority process Green: percentage occupied by user processes The memory lines also use color codes, this time to represent:\nYellow: percentage occupied by cache content Green: percentage occupied by the memory used Blue: percentage occupied by buffer content The central panel shows all the processes in progress with its associated statistics according to the use of the CPU. It shows the following information for each process:\nProcess ID (PID) The owner (User) Virtual memory consumption percentage of processor physical memory To end this program is also interactive, below we have an index where we can check the functions that allow us to use:\nWe also have several keyboards:\nor Order processes by username p Alternate with the program route F2 or S Enter Configuration F3 or / Search process F5 or t F6 + / - Select the main process to expand / contract the tree F7 or [Increase the priority only for root F8 or] Low priority (good +) F9 or k Kill process H Alterna with user process subprocesses K Alterna with kernel process subprocesses \u0026amp; The \u0026amp; symbol is a shell operator in Unix and Linux that allows you to run a background process. When setting \u0026amp; at the end of a command, the process will be run in the background and you will be assigned a task in the background. This means that the process will run in parallel with other tasks and will not block the terminal or command line until it is finished.\nJOBS This command will list the processes that are in second hand as well as their status, let us know your PID:\nFG Complementing the previous command, it allows us to resume in the foreground the last work that was suspended.:\nListing with jobs we can send a specific process to the foreground:\nBG When a command is running you can suspend it using ctrl-Z. The command will stop immediately, and you will return to the terminal shell.\nYou can resume the execution of the command in the background, so it will continue to run but it will not prevent you from doing another job in the terminal.\nKILL Linux processes can receive and react to signals. That is one way we can interact with ongoing programmes. The kill program can send a variety of signals to a program. Not only is it used to finish a program, as the name suggests, but it is its main work by default, it sends a TERM signal to the indicated process identifier.\nWe can list the signals with kill-l:\nWe send a signal with the -s parameter followed by the number of this and the PID of the process:\nXKILL This is the simplest and most practical method. The mouse cursor will be transformed into a small skull. All that remains is to click on the window you want to close and voila. Chau proceso.\nKILLALL Similar to the kill command, killall will send the signal to multiple processes at once instead of sending a signal to a specific process identifier. For example, you can have multiple instances of the top program running, and killall top will end with all of them.\nYou can specify the signal, as with kill:\nFor example we can kill all the tops:\nPIDOF Allows you to find the process ID of a running program:\n-s: Single request - orders the program to return a single process identifier\nPID BASH echo t $→ id bash\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a quick way to find the current bash identifier:\nNICE\nRun a command with a given priority, or change the priority to a process (running program). It uses a variable priority that part of the shell priority and sums up or subtract values. The lower the value of the priority the process has.\nThe value of the priority of the find process increases by 5, decreases its priority.\nRENICE It serves to change the priority of a process:\nPKILL This command allows us to kill a process from which we know your full name or part of it.

To apply this configuration to the network cards we will have to restart it as indicated at the beginning of this paragraph.\nFor the stage to work we must activate the forwarding bit for these 4 routers, in this case I will do it permanently for it we edit the / etc / sysctl.conf file and discomment this line:\nnecessary routes For my current scheme the routes we need in the routers are:\nRouter R1:\nRouter ISP:\nRouter R2:\nRouter CASA:\nConnectivity check We will do ping from each of the routers to their \u0026ldquo;farthest\u0026rdquo; ends to make sure we have done the routing correctly.\nRouter R1 - \u0026gt; R2\nRouter R1 - \u0026gt; CASA\nRouter R2 - \u0026gt; R1\nRouter R2 - \u0026gt; CASA\nRouter CASA - \u0026gt; R1\nRouter CASA - \u0026gt; R2\nWe see that all devices that have public ips addresses have connectivity between themselves but what happens to those that have private addresses on our stage, they will not have connectivity as no private addresses are routed on the internet routers.\nIn other words, if we throw a ping into a private address that is from another network, for example from the service1 to the service2 it does not arrive, as there are no routes for private directions2 on the router tables of the ISP router.\nSo it will be impossible to reach a private network other than the one we belong to.\nFor example from home if we do ping a google we do it to the address PUBLIC 8.. 8.8.8 not to the private address that the server has, can be 172.22.1.2 15\nDHCP service configuration in CASA router\nBy taking back what we had previously done in the package installation section we have already downloaded the DHCP server for debian (isch-dhcp-server). So now let\u0026rsquo;s set it up.\nThe first thing we need to do is tell our server through which network card we want this to distribute directions ip, in our case is the ens5 card.\nTo do this we will edit the /etc/default/isch-dhcp-server file and add the card name in the IPV4 section:\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s tell our DHCP server that we want to be assigned to our customers for this we edit the /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file, we can take advantage of one of the examples that are commented on and apply our configuration:\nThis is a very simple example of a dhcp server but with this is enough for our stage.\nThe fields mean:\nsubnet: network address from which we want to distribute ip addresses with this service. netmask: Network mask of the network which we want to set up the devices. range: range of addresses from which we want to distribute ips being the first the initial and the last the final. option routers: It would be the gateway of our network option broadcast-address: broadcast address of our network. Once configured with the parameters of our network we will restart the service:\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;ll check that the service is active:\nNow for customers to receive an address using this service, we will have to set the PC1 and PC2 network cards as follows:\nWe restart the service to be applied and the server automatically assign the network configuration to us:\nWe check that we have actually been assigned the network configuration:\nWe can also track who we have assigned the ip through the server by viewing the following file /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases which saves the concessions we have made.\nWe can see when it starts as well as who has been assigned by looking at their MAC address.\nNAT configuration Router CASA\nLet\u0026rsquo;s set up the SNAT in the home router seeing the current scheme the rule to do this is:\nHowever this would be eliminated when the machine was reinitiated so in this case I will add it to /etc/network/interfaces:\nSo we can see that they have been applied after relaunching the network service:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check that the rule works by seeing if I launch a ping to another network (R1) if it changes my IP address:\nWe see that by doing the capture this has changed the private address of the machine to the public of the home router so the SNAT rule would be working properly.\nRouter R2\nWe will set up SNAT and DNAT to do this I will add the rules to /etc/network/interfaces:\nWe restart the network service and see if it has been applied:\nWe will check that the SNAT works by ping the server out to a public address:\nWe see that the SNAT rule is working correctly:\nSince we have changed the private ip address to the post for the router. In the subsequent paragraphs, you will test the DNAT.\nRouter R1\nFor this router we will perform the creation of the rules in a different way, for it we will create a service to raise the rules of DNAT and SNAT when the machine is restarted to avoid adding them to the interface file.\nThe rules of DNAT and SNAT for this machine are:\nThe first thing we will have to do is create a script with our rules, so volcare with the iptables-save \u0026gt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4 command to flip the existing rules.\nWe will now create a script in which we will restore the rules we have overturned and create it on the following route /usr/local/bin/:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll have to make sure you have execution permits:\nWe will create a Systemd service file, this file must have reading and writing permissions only for root, so you must run the following command as root:\nWithin this we will add the following content, you would only have to add the route where your iptable script is found that restores the rules:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll tell the service to start automatically when the machine is restarted:\nAnd we started it:\nIf we want to make sure you have done your job properly we will look at the state of the service:\nWe will see that the rules have been automatically added:\nWe will check that the SNAT has performed us correctly by launching a ping:\nWe see that our private address has been changed to the public.\nNavigation and DNAT check Now let\u0026rsquo;s check that from the home network we can access the web servers.\nDebian client\nFrom the debian client we can make a curl to check the correct functioning of the DNAT in the Router R1:\nFrom the debian client we can make a curl to check the correct functioning of the DNAT in the Router R2:\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s check what happens if we put the private address of the different web servers:\nWe see that we cannot reach that network because the Internet routers are unable to move us to this private network as there may be thousands of devices with the same ip:\nWe would not be answered if we made a web request.\nIf we intercept a request http we see that the SNAT is done correctly, changing the applicant\u0026rsquo;s private ip to the publication of your router:\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m going to intercept a request in which DNAT is made to check that this is done correctly:\nWe can see that the origin is a public ip address while the destination is a private ip address we can see that the DNAT has been performed correctly.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m going to press a Firefox and I\u0026rsquo;ll check again that we can access the web servers just using their public ip address:\nServer 1:\nServer 2:\nWe see that using public ip address we can connect, however we cannot use the private ips addresses of the machines:\nServer 1:\nServer 2:\nIt works properly as we have managed to get our Linux routers to be able to make SNAT and DNAT by making them \u0026ldquo;use\u0026rdquo; the Internet and access the resources of other networks. Since private addresses are not routed in them, so if we check using them, we won\u0026rsquo;t get any results.\nNAT Debugging To see how many hits you have had a rule or to see how much information you have \u0026ldquo;used\u0026rdquo; each rule will use the following command:\nTo delete the counters from all the chains and rules we will use iptables -Z:\nIf our chain has hits the rule will be working properly if on the contrary it is kept in 0, the rule is not being applied so we will have to review it.\nScenario with Cisco routers We will repeat the same scenario as with the Linux routers but now using cisco routers 7200.\nPreparation of the environment Network card configuration The first thing we will do is add the necessary slots to our routers as we need 2 network cards in R1, R2 and CASA. Exams of 3 for the ISP router.\nFor the former we will add the PA-FE-TX slot, which will add a FastEthernet interface:\nWhile for the ISP router we will add PA-2FE-TX that will add two FastEthernet network interfaces.\nNow we can start the routers and start with the network card settings. I\u0026rsquo;ll use the same directions as in the previous scenario.\nRouter CASA\nWe set the network cards:\nSo we have our interfaces:\nRouter R1\nWe set the network cards:\nSo we have our interfaces:\nRouter R2\nWe set the network cards:\nSo we have our interfaces:\nRouter ISP\nWe set the network cards:\nSo we have our interfaces:\nnecessary routes ISP routes: CASA Routes: Rocks R2:\nRites R1:\nIt would only be necessary to add the default routes to Reters R1, R2 and CASA.\nConnectivity test R1 - \u0026gt; R2\nR1 - \u0026gt; CASA\nR2- → R1\nR2 - \u0026gt; CASA\nCASA - \u0026gt; R1\nCASA - \u0026gt; R2\nWe see that all devices that have public ips addresses have connectivity between themselves but what happens to those that have private addresses on our stage, they will not have connectivity as no private addresses are routed on the internet routers.\nDHCP service configuration in CASA router\nThe first thing we will do is to establish the range of IP\u0026rsquo;s excluded from the set (pool) of addresses that the service can assign indicating the initial and final ip of the range, both including:\nWe name the DHCP service range:\nWe define the network to which DHCP will serve:\nWe include the link door that the service will offer:\nWith this the DHCP server of the CASA router would already be configured, we went out and saved the changes. We will now turn on our machines and see that they are will automatically receive their DHCP configuration, with the following command we can see the service statistics:\nWe can also see the concessions with the following command:\nThis will be useful for us to track who has assigned each IP without having to go individually home machine.\nNAT configuration Router CASA\nThe first thing we will do is create an acl to allow the traffic we want to do SNAT:\nWe will assign to the internal interface of our network this rule:\nNow we will create a pool with public ips, the command would be this does not come full in the terminal:\nip nat pool ip_publica 102.168.0.2 102.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 We activate the NAT:\nWe indicate that interface is \u0026ldquo;inside\u0026rdquo;:\nWe indicate the \u0026ldquo;out\u0026rdquo; interface:\nThe SNAT would be working, so let\u0026rsquo;s check it out:\nWe see that it changes the private ip of our host to the public of the home router.\nRouter R1\nThe first thing we will do is create an acl to allow the traffic we want to do SNAT:\nWe will assign to the internal interface of our network this rule:\nNow we will create a pool with public ips, the command would be this does not come full in the terminal:\nip nat pool ip_publica 101.168.0.2 101.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 We activate the NAT:\nWe indicate that interface is \u0026ldquo;inside\u0026rdquo;:\nWe indicate the \u0026ldquo;out\u0026rdquo; interface:\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;ll check that it\u0026rsquo;s being done correctly:\nWe change the ip 172.22.1.1 to the 101.168.0.2 which is published by the router when performing a ping, so the SNAT is working properly.\nWe will now set the DNAT rule, the syntax is as follows:\nip nat inside source static tcp ip_privada puerto ip_publica puerto We will then check that the DNAT works properly. Router R2\nThe first thing we will do is create an acl to allow the traffic we want to do SNAT:\nWe will assign to the internal interface of our network this rule:\nNow we will create a pool with public ips, the command would be this does not come full in the terminal:\nip nat pool ip_publica 103.168.0.2 103.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 We activate the NAT:\nWe indicate that interface is \u0026ldquo;inside\u0026rdquo;:\nWe indicate the \u0026ldquo;out\u0026rdquo; interface:\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;ll check that it\u0026rsquo;s being done correctly:\nWe change the ip 10.0.0.1 to the 103.168.0.2 which is published by the router when performing a ping, so the SNAT is working properly. We will now set the DNAT rule, the syntax is as follows:\nip nat inside source static tcp ip_privada puerto ip_publica puerto We will then check that the DNAT works properly. Navigation and DNAT check Now let\u0026rsquo;s check that from the home network we can access the web servers.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll access using curl from a home network host. First I\u0026rsquo;ll connect to server 1:\nWe see that it responds correctly and the DNAT is applied, as it has changed the public ip of the router to the private web server:\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ll check server 2:\nWe see that it responds correctly and the DNAT is applied, as it has changed the public ip of the router to the private web server:\nWe will now check that I can access both servers from a Tiny Core with Firefox:\nTo server 1:\nTo server 2:\nWe see that we can also connect as NAT rules are working properly.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check what happens if we request the web through your private ip addresses:\nWell, obviously we don\u0026rsquo;t get an answer because in our stage we\u0026rsquo;re simulating the Internet and in this one can\u0026rsquo;t routtle private ips directions as they are can be repeated in infinity of networks.\nDebugging NAT rules Also to make sure NAT rules are working.\nThe first command allows us to view the DNAT address translation table:\nWith this command we can see how many hits have our rules, if it has none, it\u0026rsquo;s not working unless we have initialized this:\nIf we want to put the counters to zero we will use the clear command ip nat statistics.\nIf we want to see in real time the packages that show information about each package that translates the router:\nWhen decode the result of this command, observe the meanings of the following symbols and values:\n-*: the asterisk next to NAT indicates that the translation is done on the fast switching route. The first package in a conversation always applies process switching, which is slower. If there is a cache input, the rest of the packages cross the fast switching route. -S: This symbol refers to the original IPv4 address. -a.b.c.d → w.x.y.z: this value indicates that the address of origin a.b.c.d is translated to w.x.y.z. -d: = This symbol refers to the target IPv4 address. -[xxxx]= The value in square brackets is the IPv4 identification number. This information may be useful for debugging, as it enables correlation with other package follow-up by protocol analysers.\nBibliography NAT Depuration ","date":"September 8, 2023","hero":"/images/redes/configuracion_nat/portada.png","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/redes/configuracion_de_nat/configuracion_de_nat/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we will explore the configuration of SNAT (Source Network Address Translation) and DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation) in scenarios with public addresses, using routers in Linux environments and Cisco devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"scenario-with-debian-machines\"\u003eScenario with debian machines\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/redes/configuracion_de_nat/img/Aspose.Words.5d96acd8-9177-4bad-9621-78ead201ec37.001.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"preparation-of-the-environment\"\u003ePreparation of the environment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"installation-of-packages\"\u003eInstallation of packages\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the machines are placed we must download Apache for the web servers, to do this we will connect both servers to a switch and this to the NAT cloud for Internet access.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["Redes","Enrutamiento","NAT","SNAT","DNAT","Cisco","Linux"],"title":"NAT Cisco and Linux Configuration"},{"categories":null,"contents":"NAT with iptables In this article you will learn to set up a small scenario in which you can set up a series of services.

Use the following IP address: * * Here we will manually enter the desired network configuration: IP address: * * is a numerical label that identifies our machine in a unique way on our network, it cannot be repeated. Subnetwork mask: * * numerical set whose function is to indicate to devices which part of the IP address is the network number including the subnetwork, and which part is the host. Default link door: * * It is the default ip address that is assigned to a team to send the packages to other networks. In the second section of this tab we will make the configuration concerning DNS servers which will allow us to translate names into IP addresses to be able to navigate.\nGet the DNS server address automatically: * * This option will make the address get from the DHCP server we have configured on our network. Use the following DNS server addresses: * * This option serves us to manually select the ip address of our DNS servers: preferred DNS server: * * The address we put here will be the first to consult in case you need to make a resolution Alternative DNS server: * * If the primary server failed or was down at that time, we would go on to use the secondary. In the alternative configuration tab, it is designed for equipment that needs to be used in more than one network, usually seen in professional environments:\nAutomatic private ip address: * * will make use of DHCP server to configure. User-configured: * * Let us manually enter the configuration (I will omit the fields explained above): WINS preferred: * * is a Microsoft name server for NetBIOS, which maintains a table with the correspondence between IP addresses and NetBIOS computer names. alternative WINS: * * If the primary server failed or was down at that time, we would go on to use the secondary. Utility of the ping command Ping is a command or diagnostic tool that allows a state-of-the-art verification of a particular connection of a local host with at least a remote computer in a TCP / IP type network, is the most well-known network diagnostic tool.\nThe most common uses of this tool are:\nCheck network connectivity. Measure the latency that takes two points to communicate. Know the IP address used by a domain name. Scripts that allow you to keep a record of the availability of a remote server. Scripts that allow you to know when there is connection on a computer. To make use of this we will open a cmd, press WIN + R and write cmd.\nGeneral use of Ping The simplest ping syntax is as follows: ping [Parameters] [IP / Name]\nIf we look at the command output we see that it allows us to know:\nIP address * * corresponding to the name of the remote machine. The ICMP sequence number * * (\u0026ldquo;Code that returns us, ej: 0 = inaccessible network\u0026rdquo;). TTL * *: Life time in seconds; as this value is decreed in each machine in which it is processed, it must be at least equal to or greater than the number of jumps it will give. If ever this number is zero, the router will interpret that the package is traveling in circles, therefore, it ends the process. Latency: * * corresponds to the time period in milliseconds that is needed to take a turn between the source and destination machines. As a general rule, the delay of a package should not exceed 200 ms. ping statistics: * * Collects all the information showing us the lost, sent and received packages. It also shows us the package with lower latency and greater as well as an arithmetic mean. PING -T This parameter will allow us to do an infinite ping that is not to end until we kill the process, if we did not put it by default only 4 traces were sent. To complete this execution of this command we will press CTRL + C.\nWhen we stop the execution you will show us the statistics you have collected, packages sent, packages received and packages lost as well as the average back and forth times.\nPING -A This parameter serves to solve an ip in a host name, printing a line indicating the host name to which the tracks are being directed, allowing us to identify the machines more easily:\nPING -N This parameter is used to specify the number of requests that we want when sending packages, this will indicate it with a number between 1 - 4294967295.\nFor example if we want to send 10 traces the command would be as follows:\nWe can check at the bottom that you have sent in number that we have indicated.\nPING -L It allows us to change the byte size of the packages sent, we will need to specify a number between 0 and 65000.\nPING -F This parameter serves to prevent packages from fragmenting, the maximum size of unfragmented packages is 1472 bytes.\nWe can see that if we get over this number, it will give us a mistake by informing us that it is necessary to fragment the package:\nPING-I This parameter allows us to specify the maximum number that can be given to reach the destination, the maximum value that we can enter 255.\nWhen we specify a TTL this sets the maximum number of jumps, by passing through a new device (a router) this discount 1 to the TTL specifying until it reaches 0, in this case the destination will be shown as unattainable, thus preventing a package from travelling through the network indefinitely looking for a destination that may not exist.\nPING -4 -6 Ping -4: Force the host response specified with an IPv4 address. It is necessary that both the equipment that launches the ping and the destination have a correct IPv4 configuration.\nPing -6: Force the host response specified with an IPv6 address. It is necessary that both the equipment that launches the ping and the destination have a correct IPv6 configuration.\n# # Check connectivity in a network We will perform a series of tests to check the operation and find errors. The first thing will be to make ourselves ping for it:\nIf the output is correct this shows that our network adapter works properly.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to ping a machine on our local network, so we\u0026rsquo;ll show that the physical connections are correct:\nWe are going to do ping to the gateway, if successful it shows that there is connection to the computer that provides the Internet:\nWe will ping to an Internet site using ip, to check that we have Internet connection:\nFinally, doing ping to an Internet domain, if successful, shows that there is Internet connection and the DNS servers configured in the connection work correctly:\nGeneral use of the ipconfig command This command is used to view the current configuration of our computer\u0026rsquo;s network adapters, an example of general command use is as follows:\nThis shows us the following information:\nDescription of the adapter * *: Name of the adapter or network card used in the connection. IPV4 address: * * It\u0026rsquo;s the IP address assigned to the team on the local network. Default link door: * * It is the IP address of the computer provides Internet access. DNS servers: * * Address ip of the controller of solving domain name to IP address of the requested pages. There are usually two, the main and the secondary. DHCP State: * * Dynamic host configuration, in the case of the equipment shown is enabled, that means that an IP address assigned by this service will always be used. From these parameters we can consult the adapter information or identify an inconsistency in its configuration.\nIPCONFIG / ALL It will return all available information from the network adapters, it is a more detailed output than if we omitted this parameter, with this we can consult DNS servers and MAC addresses.\nIPCONFIG / RELEASE It is used to release an ip address in the DHCP service, we will not be reassigned one until we run ipconfig / reew\nWe can specify the adapter from which we want to release the ip by writing it then, if we omit the name apply them to all.\nEJ: ipconfig / release Ethernet0 - \u0026gt; Only release the ip from the Ethernet0 adapter * *\\ * * * * If we want to release an ipv6 address we will use the parameter / review6\nIPCONFIG / RENEW Once the previous command has been executed, we will have to run this to ask the DHCP server for a new IP address.\nWe can specify the adapter from which we want the DHCP offer to be renewed by writing it below.\nEJ: ipconfig / reew Ethernet0 - \u0026gt; It will only renew the Ethernet0 * *\\ * * Adapter award * * If we want to renew an ipv6 address we will use the parameter / reew6\nIPCONFIG / FLUSHDNS It is used to empty the DNS resolution cache from our local team, usually used when we want to check the proper operation of the DNS server.\nIPCONFIG / REGISTERDNS Update all DHCP concessions and re-register DNS names. This command is oriented to work in domain environments and to updating the dynamic records of the DNS server in which it is running, taking into account that if it is blocked in some way the dynamic update will not be done.\nIPCONFIG / DISPLAYDNS This command simply shows us the DNS queries that are stored in the cache of our system as shown in the image, show data from IPv4 and IPv6 protocol records.\nIPCONFIG / SHOWCLASSID This command allows us to check the user classes configured on our DHCP server and that will be available to different customers.\n\\ * If we want to check for IPV6 we will use the / showclass6 parameter.\nGeneral use ARP The arp command shows and modifies the IP address conversion tables in directions\nMAC using the address resolution protocol (ARP).\nARP-A Ask for current protocol data and show current ARP entries. If inet\\ _ addr is specified, only the IP and physical addresses of the specified equipment are shown. If there is more than one network interface using ARP, the entries of each ARP table are shown.\nThe -g option does the same function: As shown in the screen capture, the arp-a command lists all the devices currently in the host ARP cache, including the IPv4 address, the physical direction and the type of direction (static / dynamic) for each device.\nIf we want to delete the cache arp we will use the -d option followed by the\\ * wildcard to delete all the entries in this table, if we would just want to remove a query we would put the IP address.\nWe can request the MAC of an address using arp + IP of the device and then see it on our table with arp -a.\nGeneral use netstat The netstat command generates visualizations that show the state of the network and protocol statistics. The status of TCP, SCTP and UDP final points can be viewed in table format. Information about the routing table and interface information can also be viewed.\nNETSTAT -A It shows all the connections and listening ports of our team, as well as the state of the port and the remote direction which is using the same:\nNETSTAT -B It shows the executable file involved in creating each connection or listening port.\nNETSTAT -E It shows us statistics on network interfaces, it serves to see the activity that has had this:\nNETSTAT -R It shows us the routing table, so we can see the sites our team is able to reach through the network:\nNETSTAT -N It shows us the active connections with a table format, similar to the parameter - only that it indicates the port number instead of the name.\nNETSTAT -O Similar to the above parameter but this one adds the process PID:\nNETSTAT -P It allows us to filter connections according to protocol (TCP, UDP, tcpv6 or tcpv4\u0026hellip;)\nNETSTAT -T Shows the current connection\u0026rsquo;s download status:\nNetstat is very interesting to see statistical data on the connection, but it will also be very useful to analyze the open ports at a given time and thus identify problems. It is essential for certain applications and to achieve optimal performance.\nGeneral use nslookup It is an application included in all Windows systems, to consult, obtain information, test and solve problems with DNS servers.\nBy invoking it without specifying any parameter, it will return the name of the default DNS server and its IP address:\nThe command has two modes of use, the traditional through command line and the interactive. We can use it to solve address names from the terminal by putting nslookup followed by the name we want to solve:\nWe can also do reverse consultations, that is, through the ip tell us the name:\nFor example we can select the type of DNS records to make requests which are:\nA: * * to search for A records that are related to the IPv4 address.. AAAA: * * to search for AAAA records that are related to the IPv6 address. If a web uses IPv6 and so do we, then we will have to indicate this DNS record. PTR: * * to look for reverse records. MX * *: to search for Mail Exchange records of the mail. TXT: * *, to search for text records such as SPF or DKIM. CNAME: * * to search for domain aliases, this is also known as subdomains, for example, the \u0026ldquo;www\u0026rdquo; is always a main subdomain \u0026ldquo;or the typical\u0026rdquo; ftp. \u0026ldquo;which is also a subdomain. To change the registration type we use the set type = Registry name, for example:\nWe can also choose the server from which we consult as follows:\nGeneral use tracert It serves to map the route that makes an incoming package that comes from a host or network point to your computer, so we know where our trip is.\nSaying one by one all the nodes and routers through which you pass the test message you sent, their IP addresses and the latency of each of them until they reach their destination.\nThere are some nodes that are not able to answer for that the spent waiting time entries.\nWe have some interesting parameters such as:\n-d: does not convert addresses to host names -h: allows us to select the maximum number of jumps -4 or -6: Force using IPV4 or IPV6: -w: allows us to specify the waiting time in milliseconds: General use route print The Route command is used to visualize and modify the routing table. Route print shows a list of current IP routes for the host. Route add is used to add routes to the table, and route delete is used to delete routes from the table.\nSo we can specify the way to reach a network or device.\nThe syntax is as follows: route [-f] [-p] [command [destination]] [MASK network mask]\nRute print command without parameters to show all the contents of the routing table:\nIf we want to delete the routing table we must use the -f parameter:\nIn addition, we can add manual routes as follows:\n→ route add IP\\ _ Destination Mascara\\ _ Destination Door\\ _ of\\ _ interface metric link\nIf we want to change a route, the syntax is the same as the previous command by changing the add-by-change command:\nWhen we just want to remove a route, we will use the delete order followed by the destination:\nHow can you find out your router\u0026rsquo;s public IP? There is a lot of way to know this from Windows, we can use the curl command to order the following web and return the ip:\nAnother way from the command line is to do a dns consultation with nslookup to the opendns service:\nIf we have a browser we can use one of the many websites that tell us the public ip address of the router, I use the following \u0026lt;https: ipchicken.com=\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/https:\u0026gt; :\nLinux Configure a network interface To set up a Linux network card we can do it from the graphical interface or from the command line.\nFrom the graphic interface we go to Settings \u0026gt; Wireless or Network. Once here we turn on the card and give the gear.\nOnce here we can manually configure the network settings of our card.\nThe same can be done from the command line by editing the / etc / network / interfaces file with superuser permissions.\nWithin this we can indicate the configuration of our network adapters, here I tell you with commented lines the basic parameters that we can indicate in this file.\nOnce we have configured our interfaces the changes will not be applied automatically, to do this we have several forms, the most comfortable is to restart the service:\nAnother way to change the DNS servers used is through the / etc / resolf.conf file\nHere followed by nameserver we will put the address ip or name of our DNS server\nGeneral use ifconfig * * Explains the usefulness of the ifconfig command from a real capture. Is there any information from which ipconfig / all is obtained that does not appear? Try to get it another way. * *\nIt is similar to ifconfig and is focused on the same functions, this command is also used to view, change and manage all current computer network configurations.\nThis is installed with the net-tools package, to install it:\nTo use this tool we will need to do it as a superuser, with its simplest use it will show us the basic TCP / IP configuration of our network card as well as statistics of it:\nFor example with ipconfig / all we can see the configured DNS servers which with ifconfig we can\u0026rsquo;t see.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;ll have to see the / etc / resolf.conf file\nA common use of this command is to quickly set up a network interface, for example:\nWe can put this in one line.\nWe can also lift and download the network card\nGeneral use dhclient This uses the dynamic host configuration protocol to dynamically configure the network parameters of the network interface.\nThe following command will tell dhclient to release the current concession it has from the DHCP server, i.e. we want to release the current ip. We will use the -r and -v parameters\nIf we want to reorder a network configuration to the dhcp command we will use only the -v parameter.\nMainly this command is used for this, to solve problems with DHCP service configuration.\nSome parameters that I have not mentioned and may be useful are:\n-6: Serve to indicate you want IPV6 -p: Serves to indicate another port to do the consultation -s: Serves to indicate the DHCP server address Differences in netstat and ping commands with respect to Windows employees netstat shows information about the network subsystem on our computer as well as Windows. If you look at the manual, it tells us that this application is partially obsolete. The replacement of netstat is ss, for netstat -r has ip route, for netstat -i can use ip -s link and for netstat -g has ip maddr.\nIf we launch the parameter we can see to the naked view that shows us more information without indicating any parameter, otherwise these are the same as on Windows.\nWhile the ping command the difference is that it is by infinite default, unlike Windows this will not end until we stop it.\nIn this the parameters with respect to Windows change their \u0026ldquo;letter,\u0026rdquo; here would be:\n-i: Indicate the interval to send the next package in seconds (default is 1) -s: Change package size to bytes -f: flood, to test the network performance under a heavy load (send a lot of packages as quickly as possible) -c: indicate the number of traces sent -w: Stop printing the results after the indicated seconds -q: Remove the command output, quiet option -a: makes a sound when there\u0026rsquo;s an answer -V indicates the command version The utility of this is still the same, solving problems of accessibility of hosts in a network. This helps us understand why a website is not loaded.\nGeneral use command dig Dig is a command that allows you to consult DNS servers for information related to this service. To install it in our system, we will make an apt install dnsutils.\nWe can do a dns consultation, for example to the institute to check if we are able to get your address ip:\nUsing the + trace option, it does iterative consultations to solve the search for names. It will consult the server names from the root and then cross the name space tree through iterative consultations following the references on the way:\nWe can also conduct reverse consultations with the -x option:\nLinux traceroute command differences with Windows tracert command The traceroute tool is exactly the same as the tracert, but it is called otherwise, although it can internally make use of different protocols, as in some operating systems the ICMP Echo Request / reply protocol is used, and in others it makes use of UDP messages directly to check how many jumps there are from one host to another.\nThese are used to detect where the error is when accessing a particular computer and to know where the \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo; occurs.\nSome parameters that may interest us are:\n-f,: Set the distance between the first jump and the next jump. -g,: allows us to indicate the link door. I: Use ICMP ECHO -m,: Set the number of jumps; the default value is 64. -M,: the follow-up routes are carried out with ICMP or UDP; the default method is UDP. -p: Define the network port; the default value is 33434. -q: Define the number of packages per jump. -resolve-hostnames: you can use this syntax to correct the host names. -w,: Define the waiting time in seconds. General use Wget is a computer tool created by the GNU Project. You can use it to recover content and files from several web servers. The name is a combination of World Wide Web and the word get. It supports downloads through FTP, SFTP, HTTP and HTTPS.\nTo install it we use the apt install wget command.\nAn example is to download files, for example an iso. We would put the command followed by the url:\nThis will download the file to us in the current work directory.\nWe can use the command -or to indicate a different name when downloading the file:\nSome interesting parameters are:\n-P: Indicate the directory where we want to save the file \u0026ndash;limit-rate: serves to limit the download speed -tries: allows us to indicate the number of reattempts of the download -b: Make the download in the background -c to indicate that a discharge is resumed If we wanted to download files from a ftp server we would use the following syntax: wget -ftp-user = usario\u0026ndash;ftp-password = password\nGeneral use of tcpdump Tcpdump is a command line tool whose main utility is to analyze the traffic that flows through the network. Allows the user to capture and show in real time the packages transmitted and received by the network to which the computer is connected\nThe most common parameters are:\n-i allows to specify the network interface in which we are going to serve traffic. -c It allows to limit the number of packages captured in a given number. - n Avoid resolution of ports and addresses ip to names. e Show ethernet headers in addition to the ip package. t Do not print the capture time frame for each package. -x shows the hexadecimal content of the captured plot. -xx Idem to -x, but also shows the content of the Ethernet header. -X shows the hexadecimal and ASCII content of the captured plot. It just shows the ASCII content of the captured package. s Show only the first bytes from the beginning of the package. - -vv Displays additional information, including parameters of protocol headers. -w file Allows to save output in a file with pcap format. -r file allows you to read the packages previously captured and stored in a pcap file. For example we can make a capture of our network of up to 50 packages:\nAs you see the output is indecipherable, to read it we will use the ngrep command to search for coincidences without taking into account capital and lower case.\nGeneral use of the arp command The arp command will allow us to interact with the arp resolution cache, modifying it for example.\nWe can also find out the MAC address of a device, looking for it in the table:\nThe parameters are the same as we can find on Windows:\n-a: Find a particular address in the table -v: Shows all entries -n: Displays all entries in numerical form -d: removes a particular resolution We can also do this with the ip command:\nFor this the basic syntax is as follows:\nadd: Add resolution of: Delete resolution change: Change a resolution replace: replace a resolution For example to add a table:\nip command We can view and configure IP addresses, view and configure routing tables, view and configure IP tunnels, and also view and configure the physical interface.\nThis is added a \u0026ldquo;second command\u0026rdquo; to indicate your function, are as follows:\nlink: it serves us to configure physical or logical network interfaces, for example, to see the status of all network interfaces. address: allows to view and configure the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with the different network interfaces. Each interface must have at least one configured IP address. addrlabel: allows to add a label nearby: allows to see the neighborhood links, that is, you can see the ARP table of the operating system. rule: allows to view and configure routing policies and change them, this is used especially when you are going to set up several routing tables. route: allows to see and configure the routing tables, both of the main routing table and of the \u0026ldquo;secondary\u0026rdquo; that you configure. tunnel: allows to view IP tunnels and also to configure them. maddr: allows to view and configure the multilayer addresses. mroute: allows to view and configure the multicast routing table. mrule: allows to view and set up multi-direction routing policies. monitor: allows to monitor the status of network cards on a continuous basis, also IP addresses and routes. ntable: manages the neighbour cache (ARP) tuntap: manages TUN / TAP interfaces, oriented to VPN such as OpenVPN or WireGuard. maddress: configuration of the multicast addresses xfrm: manages IPsec policies. netgs: manage network name spaces l2tp: L2TP configuration tcp\\ _ metrics: manages TCP metrics. token: manages the identifiers with token of the interfaces.

The packers allow to group several files in a single container, facilitating their handling and transport. On the other hand, compressors apply techniques to reduce file size, contributing to storage space savings and expediting data transfer. These tools play a crucial role in resource optimization and operational efficiency by more effectively organizing, distributing and supporting information.\nTAR It is a file packer that as its own name indicates uses the .tar format, it is basically used to store files and directories in the same file.\nThe name of the package is tar.\nCreate a .tar file You can create compressions. An example of this type of file is:\ntar -cvf sampleArchive.tar /home/sampleArchive Here / home / sampleArchive is the directory that needs to be compressed creating ampleArchive.tar. This command uses the -cvf options that mean:\nc - create a new .tar file v - shows a detailed description of the progress of the compression f - file name Create a .tar.gz file If you want better compression, you can also use .tar.gz. An example of this is:\ntar -cvzf sampleArchive.tar.gz /home/sampleArchive The additional option * * z * * represents gzip compression. Alternatively, you can create a .tgz file that is similar to tar.gz. We show you an example of the latter:\ntar -cvzf sampleArchive.tgz /home/sampleArchive Create a .tar.bz2 file The .bz2 file provides more compression compared to gzip. However, this alternative will take more time to compress and decompress. To use it, you must use the -j option. An example of how the operation would look is as follows:\ntar -cvjf sampleArchive.tar.bz2 /home/sampleArchive This operation is similar to .tar.tbz or .tar.tb2. I\u0026rsquo;ll show you an example below:\ntar -cvjf sampleArchive.tar.tbz /home/sampleArchive tar -cvjf sampleArchive.tar.tb2 /home/sampleArchive How to decompress .tar files The Linux Tar command can also be used to extract a file. The following command will remove the files in the current directory:\ntar -xvf sampleArchive.tar If you want to extract your files to a different directory, you can use the -C option. We show you an example of this below:\ntar -xvf sampleArchive.tar -C /home/ExtractedFiles/ You can use a similar command to uncompress .tar.gz files, as shown below:\ntar -xvf sampleArchive.tar.gz tar -xvf sampleArchive.tar.gz -C /home/ExtractedFiles/ .tar.bz2 or .tar.tbz or .tar.tb2 files can be decompressed in a similar way. For this you will need to type the following command in the command line:\ntar -xvf sampleArchive.tar.bz2 How to list the content of a .tar file Once you have created the file, you can list the content by a command similar to the following:\ntar -tvf sampleArchive.tar This will show the complete list of files along with time marks and permissions. Similarly, for .tar.gz, you can use a command like:\ntar -tvf sampleArchive.tar.gz This would also work for .tar.bz2 files as shown below: tar -tvf sampleArchive.tar.bz2\nHow to decompress a single .tar file Once you create a compressed file, you can extract a single file from that tablet. This you can do with the command we show you below:\ntar -xvf sampleArchive.tar example.sh Here example.sh is a unique file that will be removed from the sample tablet Archive.tar. Alternatively, you can also use the following command:\ntar --extract --file= sampleArchive.tar example.sh To extract a single file from a .tar.gz tablet you can use a command similar to that shown below:\ntar -zxvf sampleArchive.tar.gz example.sh Or alternatively:\ntar --extract --file= sampleArchive.tar.gz example.sh To extract a single file from a .tar.bz2 tablet you can use a command like this:\ntar -jxvf sampleArchive.tar.bz2 example.sh Or, alternatively, one like this:\ntar --extract --file= sampleArchive.tar.bz2 example.sh How to extract multiple files from .tar files In case you want to extract several files, use the following command format:\ntar -xvf sampleArchive.tar \u0026#34;file1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;file2\u0026#34; For .tar.gz you can use:\ntar -zxvf sampleArchive.tar.gz \u0026#34;file1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;file2\u0026#34; For .tar.bz2 you can use:\ntar -jxvf sampleArchive.tar.bz2 \u0026#34;file1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;file2\u0026#34; Extract multiple files with a pattern If you want to remove from the tablet specific file patterns like only .jpg, use the wildcards command. A sample of this command is shown below:\ntar -xvf sampleArchive.tar --wildcards \u0026#39;\\*.jpg\u0026#39; For .tar.gz you can use:\ntar -zxvf sampleArchive.tar.gz --wildcards \u0026#39;\\*.jpg\u0026#39; For .tar.bz2 you can use:\ntar -jxvf sampleArchive.tar.bz2 --wildcards \u0026#39;\\*.jpg\u0026#39; How to add files to a .tar file While you can extract specific files, you can also add new files to an existing compressed file. To do so, you must use the -r option that means adding. The Tar command can add both files and directories.\nBelow is an example in which we are adding example.jpg to the existing sampleArchive.tar.\ntar -rvf sampleArchive.tar example.jpg We can also add a directory. In the example shown below, the image\\ _ dir directory is added to the sampleArchive.tar file\ntar -rvf sampleArchive.tar image\\_dir You cannot add files or folders to .tar.gz or .tar.bz2. tablets\nHow to verify a .tar file Using Tar can verify a file. This is one of the ways you can do it:\ntar -tvf sampleArchive.tar This cannot be applied in .tar.gz or .tar.bz2. files\nHow to verify the size of the .tar file Once you create a file, you can check its size. This will be shown in KB (Kilobytes).\nBelow are several examples of the command to be used to verify the size of different types of compressed files:\ntar -czf - sampleArchive.tar | wc -c tar -czf - sampleArchive.tar.gz | wc -c tar -czf - sampleArchive.tar.bz2 | wc -c GZIP You can compress a file using gzip with the command called gzip. Name of this package is gzip.\nThis is the simplest use: gzip filename\nThis will compress the file and add an .gz extension to it. The original file is deleted. To avoid this, you can use the - c and use the output redirection to write the output on the filename.gzfile:\ngzip -c filename \u0026gt; filename.gz the -c The option specifies that the output will go to the standard output flow, leaving the original file intact or you can use the -k option:\ngzip -k filename There are several levels of compression. The longer the compression, the longer it will take to compress (and decompress). The levels range from 1 (faster, worse compression) to 9 (slower, better compression), and the default value is 6.\nYou can choose a specific level with the - option: gzip -1 filename You can compress several files by listing them:\ngzip filename1 filename2 You can compress all files in a directory, recursively, using the -r:\ngzip -r folder gzipcan also be used to decompress a file, using the -d option:\ngzip -d filename.gz BZIP2 The bzip2 is very similar to the gzip program. The main difference is that it uses a different compression algorithm called Burrows-Wheeler block classification text compression algorithm and Huffman coding. The bzip2 compressed files will end with the .bz2. extension\nAs I said, the use of bzip2 is almost the same as gzip. We will simply have to replace gzip in the above examples with bzip2, gunzip by bunzip2, zcat with bzcat and so on.\nTo compress a file using bzip2, replacing it with a compressed version, we will run: * * bzip2 prueba.txt # Nos creara un archivo prueba.txt.bz2 Compress files without removing the original file * * If we do not want to replace the original file, we will use the -c option and write the result into a new file.\nBzip2 -c prueba.txt # prueba.txt.bz2 Uncompress files * * To decompress a compressed file we will use one of the following two possibilities:\nbzip2 -d prueba.txt.bz2 bunzip2 prueba.txt.bz2 See the contents of the compressed files without uncompressing them * * To see the content of a compressed file without uncompressing it, we will have to use any of the options:\nbunzip2 -c ubunlog.txt.bz2 bzcat ubunlog.txt.bz2 XZ The packages are xz-utils\n♪ Compress ♪\nThe simplest example of compression of a xz file is the following. File Compression with XZ\nxz deb.iso The -z option can also be used to perform the compression:\nxz -z deb.iso These orders will compress the file, but will remove the source file. If we do not seek to delete the source files, we will use the -k option as follows:\nxz -k deb.iso Uncompress * * To decompress a file, we will be able to use the -d option:\nxz -d deb.iso unxz deb.iso Forging compression * * If an operation fails, for example, if there is a compressed file with the same name, we will use the -f option to force the process:\nxz -kf deb.iso Set compression levels * * This tool supports different pre-established compression levels (0 to 9. With a default value of 6). We will also be able to use aliases like -fast (will be fast, but with less compression) to set as 0 and -best to set as 9 (slow but higher compression). Examples of how to set these levels are:\nxz -k -8 deb.iso xz -k --best deb.iso Limit memory * * In case you have a small amount of system memory and want to compress a huge file, we will have the possibility to use the -memory = limit option (the limit value may be in MB or as a percentage of RAM) to set a memory use limit for compression:\nxz -k --best --memlimit-compress=10% deb.iso ♪ Enable silent mode ♪\nIf we are interested in running the compression in silent mode, only the -q option will have to be added. We can also enable the detailed mode with -v, as shown below:\nxz -k -q deb.iso xz -k -qv deb.iso Create a tar.xz file * * The following is an example of use to get a file with the tar.xz. extension.\ntar -cf *.txt | xz -7 \u0026gt; deb.tar.xz Create a tar.xz file option 2\ntar -cJf deb.tar.xz *.txt Check the integrity of the compressed files * * We can test the integrity of the compressed files using the -t option. Using -l we can see information about a compressed file.\nxz -t deb.tar.xz xz -l deb.tar.xz #7Z\nThis compressor has two packages:\np7zip offers support for 7zr (a light version of 7z and 7za). It allows you to compress and decompress packages in these formats by using your system\u0026rsquo;s graphic tool (file-roll in Ubuntu and Debian) but does not have the encryption functionality. p7zip-full is, to put it in some way, the most complete version. Supports 7z and 7za formats and incorporates encryption functionality, in addition to compression tools ZIP Compress One or Several Files * * The format is always the same, it consists of placing 7z, followed by the option to (to compress or pack), followed by the name you want to give to the final package (no need to place the extension .7z) and ending with the name of the file to compress. You can see that 7-Zip is able to take advantage of all the cores of your processor during the operation.\n7z a paquete-comprimido archivo-a-comprimir 7z a paquete-comprimido archivo-1 archivo-2 If we want to put a password, we use the -p parameter:\n7z a -p paquete-comprimido archivo-a-comprimir 7-Zip supports several compression or packaging formats, other than its own, with this sentence you can choose to explicitly indicate which format you want to use (you can choose between 7z, zip, gzip, bzip2 or tar).\n7z a -tgzip paquete-comprimido archivo-a-comprimir List Tablet Folder Content * * Another interesting option can be to list the content within a file and see the details. To do this, you must also place yourself in the directory where the compressed file or folder is located and type the following sentence.\n7z l paquete-comprimido.7z Uncompress Package and Remove Files * * Once you have known the content within the file, to pull out all the content within the current work directory, you can use the following command:\n7z e paquete-comprimido.7z Check Data Integrity * * As an additional option, you can also check the integrity of the different files inside the compressed file. This is what you use:\n7z t paquete-comprimida.7z RAR The package to install it is rar.\nHow to compress RAR in Linux * * To compress a file or all of a folder:\nrar a nombre_fichero_comprimido.rar nombre_fichero_a_comprimir rar a nombre_fichero_comprimido.rar How to decompress RAR in Linux * * And to decompress in the same directory or another different one:\nunrar x nombre\\_del\\_rar.rar unrar x nombre\\_del\\_rar.rar /ruta/destino/descomprimido ZIP The name of the package is zip.\nTo compress files:\nzip archivo.zip archivos To decompress files:\nunzip archivo.zip See content:\nunzip -v archivo.zip Bibliography [Tar command guide] (https: / / www.hostinger.es / tutorials / como-usar-comando -tar-linux) [Gzip command guide] (https: / / tech-wiki.online / es / linux-command-gzip.html) [Bzip2 command guide] (https: / / ubunlog.com / comprymir-decomprymir-gzip-bzip2 / # The _ program _ bzip2) [Guide xz] (https: / / ubunlog.com / compression-xz-datos-sin-lost /) [Command guide 7z] (https: / / computernewage.com / 2016 / 01 / 10 / 7-zip-linux-guia -para-comprimir-y-decomprimir-files / # install -7-zip) [Rar command guide] (https: / / www.linuxaditos.com / tutorial-para-install-rari-en-linux@-@ y-learn-use) ","date":"September 8, 2023","hero":"/images/sistemas/empaquetadores/portada.jpg","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/sistemas/comandos_linux/empaquetadores_compresores/empaquetadores-compresores-descompresores/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePackers and compressors are key elements in the management of files and data in the computer field.

We only need to add the default route:\nThe routing table will look like this:\nSave the configuration:\nVampire Router Add the following routes:\nThe routing table will look like this:\nSave the configuration:\nWerewolf Router Add the following routes:\nThe routing table will look like this:\nSave the configuration:\nWolfman Router Add the following routes:\nThe routing table will look like this:\nSave the configuration:\n4. Routing Test To keep this section concise, I will verify that PC1 can reach all PCs:\n5. Configuring ACLs Everyone uses the network to send messages and flirt (so you must configure the network to allow this initially, meaning all devices can communicate with each other). However, you are fed up with all the weird creatures resulting from crossbreeding (e.g., when a vampire mates with a werewolf, and their offspring mates with a wolfman, and so on). You decide to put an end to this by implementing ACLs on the routers:\nVAMPIRES cannot communicate with the other species. Create a rule to deny traffic from the 192.168.3.0 network:\nApply it to the FastEthernet 0/0 interface (192.168.3.1) and apply it to the outgoing traffic:\nVerify that PCs in the Vampire network cannot communicate with the others. The ACL blocks the traffic:\nIf any other realm tries to communicate with them, the messages will reach them, but the response will not, as the ACL blocks outgoing traffic from the Vampire network:\nWEREWOLVES and WOLFMEN, since they are not as repulsive when they crossbreed, can communicate with each other. They cannot communicate with the other species. For this section, we can implement different solutions. I opted to add an ACL on the F2/0 interface of the Werewolf router.\nCreate the ACL:\nApply it to the outgoing traffic on the F2/0 interface:\nVerify that the ACL works by pinging between machines.\nFrom PC7, we see that we cannot leave the Werewolf router, as it blocks the communication, but we can reach other networks:\nFrom PC5, we observe the same result:\nFrom PC1, we see no response, as we are only blocking outgoing traffic, preventing internal machines from communicating with external ones:\nHUMANS cannot communicate with the other species. With the current ACL setup, it is not necessary to implement a new rule, as communication with them is already impossible. Although messages from PC1 may reach their destination, they will not receive a response.\nHowever, if we still want to prevent humans from sending messages to others from their network, we will implement the following rule on their router:\nNow we are blocking messages from humans on Router 1:\n6. DHCP Server Finally, you decide to do business with the weird creatures because they have no clue about IT. You are hired by these evil entities to perform the following tasks:\nWolfmen\nThe Wolfmen, who are terrible at assigning IP addresses to their machines, ask you to configure the DHCP service so that all their machines automatically receive a free IP.\nWe need to follow these steps:\nUse the command ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.7.1 to specify the addresses we do not want to distribute via DHCP (exclusions). Use the command ip dhcp pool WOLFMEN to name the range of addresses we are distributing. Enter the configuration for the range and specify the network we want to distribute: network 192.168.7.0 255.255.255.0. Specify the default gateway: default-router 192.168.7.1. If we want to configure a DNS server, for example, Google\u0026rsquo;s: dns-server 8.8.8.8. We can verify that the DHCP server is working correctly with the parameters we specified earlier:\nWerewolves\nThe Werewolves also hire you to assign their IPs via DHCP, but they inform you that they cannot receive the first 10 addresses of their range (excluding the network and gateway addresses), as these are reserved for their clan leaders who are traveling and will return in a few days.\nDeclare the IPs to exclude:\nName the range of addresses we are distributing to configure it:\nSpecify the network we want to distribute:\nSpecify the default gateway:\nVerify that the DHCP server is working:\nWe will create the ACL for humans:\nWe will also create the ACL for Vampires:\nWe will apply it to the inbound interface on each network, both are FastEthernet 0/0:\n*****We must have previously removed the list assigned to the interface; otherwise, it will throw an error. To remove it, use the same command as to assign it, but add a no in front.\nNow we will verify the effectiveness of these rules we have implemented:\nIT KNIGHT → SELENE and SONJA\nWe can see that it only allows traffic to these two specific hosts, as we specified in our ACLs:\nSELENE → IT KNIGHT\nWe can see that it only allows traffic to these two specific hosts, as we specified in our ACLs. If we try to communicate with another host, the ACL will block the traffic:\nSONJA → IT KNIGHT\nWe can see that it only allows traffic to these two specific hosts, as we specified in our ACLs. If we try to communicate with another host, the ACL will block the traffic:\nWe can also check the ACL statistics on the router by looking at the rule hits to see if they are working:\nAlthough we have not explicitly specified deny any in any of the lists, it is not necessary because it is implicit. By default, if no rule is matched, the traffic will be discarded.\n8. Web Server Since flirting is no longer allowed in UNDERWORLD, everyone is bored out of their minds. So, you decide to set up an internal web server in UNDERWORLD. Add a server called FILES to the BRIDGE 1 router with the IP 192.168.8.2/24, creating the necessary ACLs so that the entire UNDERWORLD community can entertain themselves by browsing some cool websites.\nFirst, we will configure the new interface on the Human router:\nNext, we will configure the route to the new network on the Vampire router to ensure proper routing in the scenario:\nFinally, we will configure the IP of our Debian server statically with the address 192.168.8.2:\nWe will also install Apache (you must do this while connected to the NAT cloud):\nOnce the web server is ready and routed in our scenario, we will modify the different ACLs so that traffic can only reach the web server on port 80.\nOn the Human router, we add the following rule, which allows all traffic to the host 192.168.8.2 on port 80:\nTo refresh the list and apply the changes, we must reassign it to the router:\nNow we will do the same on the Vampire router, as it has extended ACLs configured like the Humans:\nNow we will configure an advanced ACL for the Werewolves and Wolfmen:\nWe will verify that we cannot ping the server from the VPCs:\nIn summary, we have maintained the previous rules but allowed traffic to the web server only if it comes through port 80. That’s why we cannot ping it.\nNow we will verify that we can access the web server from the networks:\n→ HUMANS:\n→ VAMPIRES:\n→ WEREWOLVES:\n→ WOLFMEN:\n","date":"September 8, 2023","hero":"/images/redes/underworld/portada_underwolrd.webp","permalink":"https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/redes/underworld/underworld/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou live in UNDERWORLD.

Marcus and Alexander are connected to each other.\nThe scheme would be as follows:\nOn the other hand, the beings of the underworld have discovered a vulnerability in CISCO routers that allows them to bypass the access control lists, returning to the chaos you previously prevented with the ACLs.\nYour tasks will consist of:\nReplacing the CISCO routers in the network infrastructure with Linux machines following the scheme shown. Properly configure the Linux machines to function as routers. Create the necessary routing tables for all machines to communicate with each other, considering that internal networks will have private addresses and we will have public addresses on the Internet. Configure the necessary firewalls on the routers so that: VAMPIRES cannot communicate with the other species. WEREWOLVES and LYCANTHROPES, since they are not so repulsive when they meet, can communicate with each other. They will not have communication with the other species. HUMANS will also not be able to communicate with the other species. Configure the DHCP service that the werewolves and lycanthropes had under the same conditions they had when using CISCO routers. Configure the firewalls with the necessary rules so that, from HUMANLAND, IT KNIGHT can continue communicating with his two favorite vampires (SONJA and SELENE). Perform the necessary configurations to set up a web server in HUMANLAND accessible from anywhere in UNDERWORLD. Preparation of the scenario in Linux Configuration of the network interfaces The first thing we will do is add the necessary network interfaces to each router. To do this, with the machine turned off, we right-click \u0026gt; settings \u0026gt; network and add the slots that are needed for each machine:\nWe will need the following number of network interfaces for each device:\nRouter 1, 2, 3, and 4: will need 2 network interfaces MARCUS and ALEXANDER: will need 3 network interfaces PCs: will need 1 network interface Once this is done, we will edit the file /etc/network/interfaces to perform our network configuration.\nSubsequently, we will restart the networking service with systemctl restart networking.service so that the network configuration we indicated is applied.\nConfiguration of the network interface Router 1:\nConfiguration of the network interface Router 2:\nConfiguration of the network interface Router 3:\nConfiguration of the network interface Router 4:\nConfiguration of the network interface Router MARCUS:\nConfiguration of the network interface Router ALEXANDER:\nEnabling the forwarding bit If we want to make a Linux machine act as a router, which means it routes packets that are not destined for it, we must enable the forwarding bit.\nAdditionally, we will take this opportunity to permanently enable the forwarding bit on the routers of the scenario by editing the file /etc/sysctl.conf and uncommenting this line:\nWe will repeat this for the six routers we have in the scenario:\nRouter 1:\nRouter 2:\nRouter 3:\nRouter 4:\nRouter MARCUS:\nRouter ALEXANDER:\nNow all our machines are configured to act as routers and will route any packets that are sent to them that are not for them.\nRoute configuration Here I will show if I have added any routes manually and the routing tables of the devices.\nRouter MARCUS:\nRouter ALEXANDER:\nRouter 1:\nRouter 2:\nRouter 4:\nWith the network configuration I have on the interfaces, I have only added 2 manual routes on the routers of MARCUS and ALEXANDER; in the rest it was not necessary since it is generated automatically with the gateway we placed when configuring the network interfaces.\nI could have saved writing them if I had placed the IP of the other as the gateway on the interface configured in the network 100.X.X.X.\nConnectivity test We are going to check if we have routed correctly, so I will ping from each router to each one of the edges of the scenario.\nRouter 1:\nRouter 2:\nRouter 3:\nRouter 4:\nIt is confirmed that we have connectivity between all routers; the PCs will not have “connectivity” until we configure the SNAT.\nDHCP Configuration Lycanthropes The lycanthropes, on their part, hire you to assign their IPs via DHCP as well, but they indicate that they cannot receive the first 10 addresses of their range (not counting the network one or the gateway), as these are reserved for the leaders of their clan who are traveling and will return in a few days.\nWith the machine connected to the NAT cloud and the interface that is connected configured via DHCP, we will download the DHCP server; to do this, we must first run an apt update because the machine does not have the repositories loaded in memory:\nWhen it finishes installing, it will give us an error; this is because the service is not configured and does not know which interface the server should assign addresses to:\nTo do this, we will edit the file /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server and add the name of the interface in the IPV4 section:\nNow we will configure the scope with the requirements requested by the lycanthropes by editing the file /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf:\nWe must keep in mind that the configuration we put here is consistent with the network configuration we have; we need to consider that we have a /28, so in this case, we can only have 14 assignable addresses.\nBut if we follow the statement, they do not want the first 10, so we can only assign 3 to our clients.\nOnce this is done, we will restart the service:\nAnd we will see if it is working, checking the status:\nWe will assign an IP to a PC to check that it works:\nWerewolves The werewolves, who are quite clumsy at entering IP addresses into their machines, ask you to configure the DHCP service for all their machines to receive an IP automatically.\nWith the machine connected to the NAT cloud and the interface that is connected configured via DHCP, we will download the DHCP server;
