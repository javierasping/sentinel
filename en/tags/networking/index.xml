&lt;p>In this detailed post, we explore the process of configuring IPv6 to IPv4 tunnels and vice versa in Linux and Cisco environments. As the migration to IPv6 gains importance, the ability to establish communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks becomes essential. We will cover the basics of tunnel configuration, including the most common types of tunnels, such as 6to4 and Teredo. Additionally, we will provide step-by-step instructions for configuration on both Linux systems and Cisco devices.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Underworld</title><link>https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/redes/underworld/underworld/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/redes/underworld/underworld/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You live in UNDERWORLD. In your world, there are different types of species with one goal: to &amp;ldquo;crossbreed&amp;rdquo; with each other. These creatures are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>VAMPIRES&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>WEREWOLVES (LICÁNTROPOS):&lt;/strong> Werewolves with the ability to return to their human form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>WOLFMEN (HOMBRES LOBO):&lt;/strong> Werewolves who, after their first transformation, cannot return to their human form.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>HUMANS:&lt;/strong> Some annoying little creatures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>YOU:&lt;/strong> A tech-savvy warrior with superpowers like turning around a game that hasn&amp;rsquo;t even been released yet or having the ability to become invisible when going out to party and trying to flirt with a girl by saying things like: &amp;ldquo;Do you want me to compile your kernel, babe?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The layout of UNDERWORLD is as follows:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Underworld evolution</title><link>https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/redes/underworld_evolution/underworld_evolution/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.javiercd.es/en/posts/redes/underworld_evolution/underworld_evolution/</guid><description>&lt;p>The world of UNDERWORLD has evolved greatly in recent months, so you must perform network management tasks to face the new situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, the Internet has been discovered in the Underworld, allowing each of the sub-worlds (remember: vampires, werewolves, lycanthropes, and humans) to connect to a router that, in turn, connects them to one of the two large routers that form Underworld&amp;rsquo;s Internet, called Marcus (for humans and vampires) and Alexander (for werewolves and lycanthropes). Marcus and Alexander are connected to each other.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
