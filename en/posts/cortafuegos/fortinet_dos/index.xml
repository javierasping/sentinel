To this end, I have transformed client 1 into Odin, and added Thor and Loki as virtual machines instead of containers on the LAN network. I have also created a new network called DMZ, in which will be the Hela machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I have transformed the previous scenario into this new one, we have some rules created earlier. Therefore, I will remove from the statement those that are already created, such as making SSH to Odin from port 2222, but with the service listening in the 22.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
