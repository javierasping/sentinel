The SMB protocol is a network protocol that allows Windows operating systems to communicate with other network devices, such as file servers, printers and other shared resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samba facilitates interoperability between Windows systems and Unix / Linux-based operating systems by allowing Unix systems to share files and resources with Windows systems using the SMB / CIFS protocol. This means that a Samba server can act as a file server for Windows customers, allowing them to access and share files as if they were in a Windows environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
