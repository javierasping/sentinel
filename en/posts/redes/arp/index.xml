Its main function is to find the MAC address associated with a specific IP address on a local network. When one device needs to communicate with another on the same network, it uses ARP to determine the MAC address of the destination before sending data.&lt;/p&gt;

Make a Wireshark capture of an ARP request and analyze it to justify your response.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is a message of dissemination as in the header we can see that the destination has a broadcast address. This address is the one that has all its bits at 1 which in the mac addresses is translated into FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
