# KVM Architecture and Operation

## What is KVM?

KVM, or **Kernel-based Virtual Machine**, is a software feature that can be installed on Linux systems to create virtual machines (VMs). A virtual machine acts as an independent computer within another physical machine, sharing resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth with the host system.  

KVM is a component of the Linux kernel that has provided native virtualization support since 2007, turning any Linux machine into a **bare-metal hypervisor**.

## Importance of KVM

KVM allows developers and system administrators to:

- Scale computing infrastructure without new hardware.  
- Automate the provisioning of virtual environments.  
- Quickly deploy a large number of VMs, especially in cloud environments.

The main advantages of KVM include:

- **High performance:** virtualization is performed close to the hardware, reducing latency.  
- **Security:** VMs benefit from Linux security features, including SELinux.  
- **Stability:** KVM has over a decade of development and support from an active open-source community.  
- **Cost-effectiveness:** it is free and open-source, with no additional licensing required.  
- **Flexibility:** supports different hardware configurations and fine-grained resource provisioning.

## How KVM Works

To run KVM, the following are required:

- A CPU that supports virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V).  
- An updated Linux kernel.  
- Additional components: kernel module, processor-specific module, emulator, and complementary Linux packages.

### KVM Architecture

KVM is based on **two main components**:

1. **Kernel modules:**  
   - `kvm.ko`, `kvm-intel.ko`, and `kvm-amd.ko`.  
   - Provide the virtualization infrastructure and processor-specific drivers.

2. **User space:**  
   - `qemu-system-ARCH` emulates virtual devices and manages the VMs.  
   - Can be managed via QEMU tools (`qemu-img`, `qemu-monitor`) or through the libvirt stack (`virsh`, `virt-manager`, `virt-install`).

In practice, the term **KVM** is commonly used to refer both to the kernel-level functionality and the user-space component.

### How VMs Run on KVM

- VMs run as **normal Linux processes** on the host.  
- Each vCPU is implemented as a **normal thread**, managed by the Linux scheduler.  
- Advanced kernel features (NUMA, huge pages) are not automatically inherited.  
- Disk and network performance depend on host configuration.  
- Network traffic typically passes through a **software bridge**.  
- Emulation of specific devices may introduce **additional overhead**.

## Differences Between KVM and VMware ESXi

| Feature | KVM | VMware ESXi |
|---------|-----|------------|
| License | Open-source | Commercial |
| Integration | Linux kernel | Proprietary kernel |
| Support | Open-source community | Professional support |
| Flexibility | High, fine-grained provisioning | High, but license-dependent |
| Environment | Linux | Linux/Windows |
