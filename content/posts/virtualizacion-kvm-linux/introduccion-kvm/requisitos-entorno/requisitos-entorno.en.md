# Requirements and Environment Preparation for KVM

To run virtual machines with **KVM**, it is essential that the Linux host meets certain **hardware and software requirements**. Below are the key aspects to consider before starting virtualization.

## Hardware Requirements

1. **CPU with virtualization support**
   - Intel: VT-x  
   - AMD: AMD-V  
   - Must be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI.  
   - On Linux, this can be verified with:
     ```bash
     grep --color -Ew 'svm|vmx|lm' /proc/cpuinfo
     ```
     - `vmx` → Intel CPU with VT-x  
     - `svm` → AMD CPU with AMD-V  
     - `lm` → 64-bit support

2. **RAM**
   - Depends on the number of VMs and workload.  
   - Each VM requires dedicated memory; for testing environments, at least 8 GB is recommended.

3. **Storage**
   - Enough space for VM images and snapshots.  

4. **Network**
   - Linux-compatible network adapter to create bridges and allow VM connectivity.
